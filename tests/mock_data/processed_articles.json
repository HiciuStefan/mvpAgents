    "title": "DORA Compliance for Financial Institutions",
    "content": "ResourcesBlogDORA Compliance for Financial InstitutionsByRishabh Poddar | Co-Founder and CTO2024-07-30•2 minutes ReadHow Confidential AI Combines Data Protection with AI InnovationThe Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is a comprehensive framework established by the European Union to ensure that the financial sector operates safely in the face of increasing digital threats.One of the most comprehensive and strict regulations to date, the act is a pivotal moment for the financial services industry asits reliance on digital technologies, including AI, has significantly increased over the past several years, making it more vulnerable to cyber threats and ICT disruptions. To shield organizations from these threats, DORA lays outstringent requirementsfor data protection, risk management, continuous monitoring, incident response, and operational resilience.To comply with this new framework, financial institutions operating in the EU must adopt advanced security measures. They need solutions that can safeguard data throughout its lifecycle—from storage and transmission to processing. As financial entities strive to meet these standards by January 2025, Opaque Systems' confidential AI platform offers a solution that not only ensures compliance, but also enables continued innovation with AI.Opaque’s Confidential AI Brings Resilience to Financial ServicesOpaque’s Confidential AI platform allows for secure and private machine learning and data analysis, ensuring that sensitive financial data used in AI models is protected, thereby accelerating AI into production. This capability is particularly vital in meeting DORA’s requirements, as it combines the power of AI with the highest standards of data security.The platform is designed to handle large-scale data processing securely while maintaining high performance. Its interoperability with existing IT infrastructure allows financial institutions to integrate confidential AI into their workflows, and remain compliant without the need for extensive system overhauls.Opaque Delivers DORA Compliance, Collaboration, and Risk ManagementOpaque leverages confidential computing to power its confidential AI platform and provide a secure environment for data processing and analytics. By using hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Opaque keeps data encrypted at rest, in transit, and during computation, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches and shielding sensitive information. Opaque’s ability to maintain the confidentiality of data in use is a particularly crucial differentiator, since it’s anexplicit DORA requirement.By isolating sensitive computations within the TEEs, Opaque minimizes the attack surface available to adversaries. This isolation not only protects data but also strengthens resilience against—or ability to withstand—cyber incidents, aligning with DORA’s emphasis on operational stability.Real-time monitoring and detailed audit trails enhance operational stability and resilience as well, providing continuous visibility into data processing activities and facilitating rapid response to any security incidents. This capability uniquely supports DORA’s mandates for efficient incident management, ensuring that financial institutions can quickly address and mitigate cyber threats.Data processing rarely happens in a vacuum—financial services providers often work across geographies and jurisdictions, collaborate with other institutions, and engage with third-party providers that analyze or manage their data. To support these needs, Opaque’s protection takes data sovereignty and localization into account, ensuring that sensitive data processing adheres to local regulations and complies with DORA’s governance and risk management standards.The platform also enables secure multi-party computation, allowing multiple financial entities to perform joint data analysis without exposing their individual datasets. And, when third-party players are involved, the platform significantly mitigates risks by securing data during processing. This alignment with DORA’s focus on managing external dependencies ensures that third-party services remain resilient and secure.Innovating With ConfidenceAs financial institutions navigate the complexities of DORA compliance, Opaque’s confidential AI platform is a comprehensive solution. By providing robust data protection, real-time monitoring, secure collaborative analytics, and advanced AI capabilities, Opaque ensures that financial entities can meet DORA’s requirements and operate safely.To learn more about what Confidential AI can do for you, request a demohere.Related ContentShowing1GuardRail OSS, open source project, provides guardrails for responsible AI developmentThis is some text inside of a div block.GENERALRead MoreAugust 30, 2024Blog5 Ways to DORA-Proof Your Business With Confidential AIAugust 30, 2024BlogRead MoreHave a question about OPAQUE’s Confidential Computing Platform or want to ",

    "title": "Beyond Microservices: How AI Agents Are Transforming Enterprise Architecture",
    "content": "ResourcesBlogBeyond Microservices: How AI Agents Are Transforming Enterprise ArchitectureByAaron Fulkerson | CEO2025-01-06•3 minutes ReadIn a recently publishedwhitepaper on AI agents, Google offers a compelling vision of the future of enterprise architecture. As the CEO of Opaque Systems, I find this particularly relevant to our mission of enabling secure and private AI computing. Let me explain why this represents such a fundamental shift in how we build enterprise systems.The Evolution from Microservices to AI AgentsToday’s enterprise applications largely follow microservices architecture principles – small, independently deployable services that communicate via well-defined APIs. This approach has served us well, offering benefits like scalability, technological flexibility, and team autonomy. However, AI agents represent a profound evolution of these concepts.Consider how a typical microservice operates: it receives a request, processes it according to predetermined business logic, and returns a response. Now, imagine replacing that rigid service with an intelligent agent that can perceive its environment, make autonomous decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. This is the transformation we’re witnessing.The Agent Architecture LandscapeGoogle’s whitepaper outlines several types of agents, each building upon microservices principles while adding layers of intelligence:Simple Reflex AgentsThese parallel basic microservices but add conditional intelligence. Instead of just processing requests, they actively observe and respond to their environment. Think of an intelligent routing service that doesn’t just follow rules but adapts to system conditions in real-time.Model-Based Reflex AgentsThese extend further by maintaining internal state – similar to stateful microservices but with sophisticated environmental modeling capabilities. These agents can make predictions and decisions even with incomplete information, far surpassing traditional caching or state management approaches.Goal-Based AgentsThese represent a significant leap beyond traditional microservices. While microservices execute predefined processes, goal-based agents actively plan and adjust their actions to achieve specific objectives. This transforms static service orchestration into dynamic, purpose-driven behavior.Utility-Based AgentsThese add another dimension by incorporating sophisticated decision-making capabilities. Unlike microservices that follow fixed business rules, these agents can evaluate trade-offs and optimize for multiple competing objectives.Learning AgentsThese perhaps best exemplify the departure from traditional microservices. They continuously improve through experience, fundamentally changing how enterprise systems evolve. Instead of requiring explicit updates, these systems autonomously enhance their capabilities.Multi-Agent SystemsThese represent the most sophisticated evolution, where multiple agents – potentially of different types – work together collaboratively or competitively to achieve complex goals. Unlike traditional microservice orchestration, these agents can dynamically form alliances, negotiate resources, and adapt their interactions based on changing conditions. Think of it as moving from a traditional hierarchical corporate structure to an agile workforce where independent teams dynamically collaborate, compete, and self-organize to achieve objectives. I discussed these multi-agent systems in the context ofAgentic Workflows with Jason from Anthropic on a recent podcast episode,and we’re seeing customers of Opaque adopt these for some pretty basic workflows like RAG pipelines, but these compositions will undoubtedly replace entire enterprise software systems.The Critical Role of Security and PrivacyThis architectural evolution introduces new challenges that make confidential computing more crucial than ever:Agent Authentication and Attestation:Unlike traditional microservices where authentication primarily involves API keys or certificates, AI agents require sophisticated attestation mechanisms to prove their authenticity and behavioral integrity. These agents are unlike microservices today because the logic is non-deterministic, and the model will become increasingly intelligent and capable of executing autonomously to call and process resources. This is where Opaque’s attestation capabilities become essential.Model Protection:Organizations investing in specialized AI agents need assurance that their intellectual property remains protected. Confidential computing provides the foundation for deploying agents without exposing their valuable internal models.Data Sovereignty:As agents access and process sensitive data across organizational boundaries, we need cryptographically enforced data governance. This goes beyond traditional microservice security patterns, requiring sophisticated privacy-preserving computation capabilities.Looking Forward: The Intelligent EnterpriseThe shift from microse",

    "content": "ResourcesBlog5 Ways to DORA-Proof Your Business With Confidential AIByAaron Fulkerson | CEO2024-08-30•3 minutes ReadAs the countdown to the enforcement of the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) begins, financial institutions and the ICT companies that support them aregearing up for a significant shift. DORA, set to take effect in early 2025, aims to fortify the financial sector against the growing threats of cyberattacks and data breaches. The act is anchored in five pillars: ICT risk management, incident reporting, digital operational resilience testing, third-party risk management, and collaborative information sharing. Adhering to each of these pillars requires a robust and resilient digital infrastructure. But how can businesses ensure they are fully DORA-compliant?The answer lies in adopting confidential AI, like the platform offered by Opaque Systems. Opaque’s solution provides the tools necessary to not only comply with DORA’s requirements, but also to enhance digital resilience, and make it quick and easy to do so.1. ICT Risk Management: Proactive Defense with Confidential AIDORA requires organizations to have comprehensive ICT risk management processes and state-of-the-art security measures. Opaque’s confidential AI platform meets these requirements by using hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which keep data encrypted at rest, in transit, and during computation. This approach helps financial institutions reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches, and enables them to perform automated risk assessments without risking data exposure.Overall, our platform's encryption capabilities ensure that financial institutions can securely  manage their data throughout its lifecycle, and take proactive defense measures against cyber threats.2. Incident Reporting: Swift, Secure, and CompliantIn the event of a cyber incident, DORA mandates timely and detailed reporting to regulatory bodies. Opaque’s platform supports this by enabling real-time monitoring and detailed audit trails, which uniquely support efficient incident management. These techniques can help businesses perform root cause analyses to pinpoint the origins of security incidents, and quickly report them to the appropriate organizations such as the European Banking Authority (EBA).Our platform’s capabilities not only power compliance with DORA’s reporting requirements, but also ensure that financial institutions can quickly address and mitigate cyber threats.3. Digital Operational Resilience Testing: Simulating Threats SafelyDORA emphasizes the importance of regular digital resilience testing to prepare for potential cyberattacks. Organizations that use Opaque’s solution are able to rigorously test their systems against cyber threats and ensure they are prepared to tackle real-world scenarios, such as attacks by bad actors. The ability to securely process encrypted data allows our customers to easily meet this DORA requirement and provide a verifiable audit trail to prove adherence.For instance, Accenture, in collaboration with UC Berkeley and Opaque Systems, is working with government agencies to enable cyber security agencies and telcos to securely share data on suspicious IP addresses and malicious activities. This collaboration aims to protect citizens from cyber threats by facilitating secure data sharing and analysis, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential throughout the process.4. Third-Party Risk Management: Secure Data Sharing with PartnersManaging third-party risk is a critical component of DORA. Opaque’s platform enables secure and confidential data sharing with third-party vendors and partners. By leveraging confidential computing, organizations can share data with third parties without exposing it to unauthorized access, thus minimizing the risk of data breaches. This capability certifies that all parties involved in the financial ecosystem maintain the same high standards of data protection.5. Collaborative Information Sharing: Strengthening Industry-Wide SecurityDORA encourages collaborative information sharing among financial institutions to enhance industry-wide security. Opaque’s platform facilitates this by enabling secure, encrypted information exchanges between organizations. Our team pioneered verifiably private data collaboration during our research and development of a multiparty collaboration and competition platform at Berkeley RISELab in 2021, led by a team that included our co-founders Ion Stoica and Raluca Ada Popa. This platform enabled multiple data owners to perform joint analytics and machine-learning model training on collective data—without revealing their individual data to each other—and served as the foundation for our Confidential AI platform.By maintaining data confidentiality during collaboration, financial institutions can share insights and threat intelligence without compromising sensitive information, thus contributing to a more resilient financial se",

    "content": "ResourcesBlogWhy Data Anonymization Isn’t Enough in the Age of AIByRishabh Poddar2024-04-24•5 minutes ReadWe are living in a time of unprecedented data generation. According to some estimates,90% of the world’s datawas created in the last two years. The same sources say that 328.77 million terabytes of data are created each day — to put that into perspective, you can store 500 hours of movies on 1 terabyte alone. From a business perspective, the more data the better, especially in the age of AI. Yet enterprises are at an impasse because typically, a company’s most valuable data is also its most sensitive—such as confidential data about customers or personally identifiable information (PII).To date, this data has often gone unused because companies lack a universally reliable mechanism to secure it. Now, with the rise of AI, fears of data exposure are growing among the enterprise. Attackers are already using prescriptive analytics to compromise current-generation anonymization technologies. Generative AI (GenAI) further lowers the barrier for bad actors to mount attacks, as they can now leverage natural language interfaces to design new strategies and toolkits.What’s needed is an additional security layer that can enable the sharing of sensitive data without compromising its confidentiality. With a purpose-built data collaboration environment, teams can dramatically simplify anonymization and sharing processes.Data Security As it StandsToday,6 in 10 organizationssay they use an enterprise-wide solution to protect their proprietary data. These anonymization technologies range from largely manual efforts at data redaction that can be reverse-engineered, to sophisticated technologies that use encryption, noise, algorithms, and other techniques to enable collaborative use of underlying data sets without revealing identifying characteristics.But with how costly and time-consuming they are, these practices don’t seem to be cutting it anymore. Overtwo-thirds of IT and security leadersbelieve the accelerated data growth across their infrastructure is “outpacing their ability to secure data and manage risk.”Privacy-enhancing technologies businesses use today vary in difficulty to implement and have underlying flaws (e.g. cost prohibitive, time-consuming, lack of verification, etc.):Synthetic data generation: Creates new data based on the properties of underlying datasets. The easiest way to do this is with GenAI: Data teams can use natural language queries to create and refine new datasets. Alternatively, data, IT, and security teams can randomize data, create generative adversarial networks, or use other approaches to create artificial data for analysis.Differential privacy:This technique adds noise to original datasets when collected or before sharing to ensure that underlying information can’t be re-identified. Data, IT, and security teams must analyze data; decide how much noise to add; and when to interject it, such as into query results or into algorithms during training.Homomorphic encryption:This enables computing on encrypted data. This technology can be challenging for data, IT, and security teams to set up, as it requires specialized cryptographic knowledge, libraries, frameworks, and tools. In addition, data must be encrypted to perform computations and then decrypted to review results.Secure multi-party computation: This approach allows multiple parties to use encrypted data sets while protecting each party’s data from other parties’ approved users and adversaries. These groups must jointly set up a protocol to communicate securely, agree on the desired shared computational method, and protect their data, making this approach difficult to realize.Each of these technologies provides important data protection techniques for specific use cases. But if human experts can reverse-engineer data, imagine what powerful algorithms can accomplish.How AI Is Raising the Stakes on Data AnonymizationLarge-language models (LLM) and enterprise proprietary models create greater data exposure threats as development races ahead of guardrails. These risks (discussed in more detailhere), include the following development stages:Pre-training models:LLMs use large datasets that are preprocessed to anonymize or redact PII. However, sensitive data may slip in, given the sheer volume of data and the number of sources used.Fine-tuning models:LLMs are retrained on specific data sets to improve their ability to complete certain tasks, such as synopsizing clinician-patient interactions. However, models can learn new patterns and memorize data components, inadvertently revealing sensitive details—even if confidential information is removed. For example, LLMs analyzing interaction notes at scale could leak individual patients’ medical histories.Conducting model inference:Enterprise business teams can input sensitive or confidential data, including PII, into models, which can be used to improve output. As a result, this data could potent",

    "content": "ResourcesBlogThe Generative AI Tipping Point: Unleash Innovation While Upholding PrivacyByAaron Fulkerson2024-02-26•1 Minute ReadBusinesses are charging ahead with generative AI, lured by the astounding potential of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to fast-track progress. However, unchecked adoption risks unprecedented data leaks.This is the inconvenient truth that threatens to destabilize the AI revolution.Without robust privacy safeguards, improperly secured user inputs containing sensitive details could become malicious actors’ playground. Confidential business data could end up training competitors’ models. Trust in AI hangs precariously amidst the onslaught of cyberattacks, with inference attacks adding another potent privacy threat.While data anonymization provided some reassurance thus far, LLMs defeat these protection schemes by identifying trace patterns. Likewise, differential privacy through noise infusion degrades analytical utility for negligible privacy gains.The Problem Behind AI’s Privacy PerilLLMs accumulate copious training data from diverse sources, increasing exposure to confidential information and escalating privacy risks. Simultaneously, companies already face marked increases in insider-related incidents, compounding vulnerabilities.As AI capabilities grow more advanced in unraveling complex patterns, so do the associated hazards of extracting and reproducing sensitive knowledge. Without intervention, these risks threaten to sabotage public trust, trigger lawsuits, and invoke restrictive regulations−severely limiting AI’s potential.The Solution: Confidential Computing for Trusted AIConfidential computing seamlessly addresses generative AI’s privacy pitfalls through encrypting data and isolating execution within hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs).This game-changing privacy-enhancing technique defends against inference attacks by concealing model internals and preventing reconstruction of sensitive training data. TEEs also thwart malicious system access even from insider threats.Equally crucial, high-speed encrypted computation preserves analytical accuracy−overcoming limitations of other privacy schemes. Organizations can thus remain compliant while fully capitalizing on AI capabilities.The confidential computing standard spearheaded by UC Berkeley and Intel research allows collaborating securely on generative AI across multiple parties. Data owners, model creators, and users participate without risking their respective intellectual property, proprietary data, or personal information.Analysis shows most companies gain over 60% ROI just from privacy investments with bigger payoffs for those adopting cutting-edge confidential computing.

    "content": "ResourcesBlogAnonymized Datasets Aren’t As Anonymous As You ThinkByRishabh Poddar | Co-Founder and CTO and Ian Chang | UC Berkeley / Univ. of Washington2024-10-02•4 minutes ReadAnonymized datasets are widely used across industries, from healthcare to marketing, to unlock valuable insights while preserving privacy. However, these datasets carry a hidden risk: they’re far more vulnerable to deanonymization than we often realize. Traditional methods of anonymizing data—removing HIPAA identifiers, tokenizing PII fields, or “adding noise” to the data—might seem reliable, but they frequently fail to protect privacy fully.Consider the famous case of the Netflix Prizedataset from 2006. Netflix released an anonymized set of movie ratings to encourage the development of better recommendation algorithms. Yet, by 2009, researchers discovered they could re-identify some users by cross-referencing this data with other publicly available datasets.Another glaring example is Latanya Sweeney’s2000 study, where she showed how combining public records (like voter registration data) with ZIP codes, birth dates, and gender could deanonymize supposedly anonymous datasets.Security researchers have long been aware of the risks associated with traditional anonymization techniques. Yet, organizations have continued to adopt and deploy these methods to protect their data. Why?First, until recently, there simply haven’t been suitable or practical alternatives for ensuring privacy at scale. Techniques like differential privacy and fully homomorphic encryption are promising, but they are often too complex, costly, or impractical for widespread adoption in everyday applications. (More on this later.)Second, while the potential for re-identification exists, the barriers to mounting such attacks have historically been somewhat high, requiring significant effort and expertise. These barriers are lowering drastically, making the risks of deanonymization more pressing than ever.Today’s New Threat: Large Language Models (LLMs)As anonymization techniques evolve, so too do the tools that can breach them. In recent years, we’ve witnessed a dramatic rise in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT. These models, trained on vast datasets that include publicly available information, have revolutionized many industries—but they’ve also introduced new privacy concerns. Unlike earlier deanonymization methods, which required technical expertise and effort, LLMs now have the ability to process and analyze vast amounts of information quickly and automate much of this process. This makes the deanonymization not only faster and more efficient, but also more accessible to a wider range of actors, raising the stakes for protecting anonymized data. To illustrate the magnitude of this threat, we ran a simple experiment using a dataset from the Personal Genome Project (PGP), an initiative where participants voluntarily share their genomic and health data for research purposes.We downloaded the publicly available PGP Participant Survey1, which contains profiles of 4000+ participants. Each participant is assigned an ID as the reference to their profile. The profiles in the dataset appear in a de-identified state, and do not directly contain the participant’s name or address. The dataset includes partially noised demographic information, e.g., their age in 10-year ranges along with gender and ethnicity, as well as medical and genomic information.Let’s take one notable participant from the PGP study—Steven Pinker, a cognitive psychologist and public figure—and attempt to re-identify his profile. Using only GPT-4o and publicly available information, such as his Wikipedia biography and a Financial Times article, we were able to match Pinker to his profile in the PGP database. (Note: Like many other PGP participants, Pinker has chosen to be public about his identity and participation in the PGP study.)We used the following information on Pinker’s biography as auxiliary data we provided to GPT:Steven Pinker was born in 1954, making him 69 years old. He is male, of Jewish descent, with grandparents from Poland and Moldova. His profession is in academia, specifically cognitive psychology, and he has been a public advocate for open science.Using this auxiliary information, we prompted GPT to score the 4,000+ participants row-by-row, and rating each match from 1 to 100. If any major discrepancies appeared, such as a male participant’s gender being female, we instructed the model to penalize the score.How much does the following data match Steven Pinker on a scale of 1 to 100? If there is any definitively wrong descriptor (e.g. the sex/gender is opposite to that participant what is publicly known about Steven Pinker), dock the score by a lot. Give only a numeric score and no explanation.In this way we instructed GPT to go through the rows in the dataset and score how closely related each row is to Steven Pinker. The goal was to arrive at a list of candid",

    "content": "ResourcesBlogBridging the Gap: Hyperscalers and Verifiable Data Sovereignty with Opaque, Confidential AI PlatformByRishabh Poddar | Co-Founder and CTO2024-09-17•1 Minute ReadIn today’s AI-driven world, hyperscale cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services are indispensable. They provide the infrastructure that enables enterprises to scale their workloads efficiently, while safeguarding their valuable, sensitive data and models. While these services leverage a solid foundation, there’s still significant complexity involved in building a comprehensive solution that fully addresses customers’ needs.When it comes to data—the lifeblood of any organization—relying solely on hyperscalers’ confidential computing solutions is like renting an empty lot with a fence. Yes, you get the land and some basic security, but the responsibility to build, equip, and safeguard the space lies with you. A critical step to data protection, multi-cloud confidential computing environments support the infrastructure layer, ensuring that data remains protected during computation across multiple cloud environments. However, addressing the full complexity of ensuring data privacy and sovereignty while accelerating AI workloads demands a more comprehensive approach.That’s where specialized confidential AI solutions come in.These solutions enhance data sovereignty by addressing gaps that hyperscalers alone cannot fully cover:Comprehensive Privacy Controls:They offer end-to-end encryption for data at rest, in transit, and in use, ensuring complete protection across the data lifecycle.Integrated Key Management:Cryptographically enforced data governance and policies enable seamless encryption key management.Remote Attestation:These systems ensure software and hardware integrity through real-time verification, protecting against tampering.Isolated Environments:Confidential AI platforms provide verifiable isolation of infrastructure, ensuring data is safe from both internal and external threats.Scalable Processing:They deliver encrypted, scalable, and reliable data processing without sacrificing privacy or performance.Built-in Compliance:Specialized solutions simplify meeting compliance and regulatory requirements by integrating these features directly into the platform.Tamper-Proof Audits:Verifiable, tamper-proof audit trails are included to ensure transparency and accountability across all data processes.By addressing these critical areas, confidential AI solutions simplify the complex task of maintaining data privacy in AI workloads, which is otherwise left to users when relying solely on hyperscale infrastructure. At Opaque, we’ve designed a turnkey business that addresses this gap.Rather than simply providing the infrastructure, we offer a fully furnished office—complete with all the features you need to protect your data and AI workloads right out of the box. From encrypted processing to verifiable audit trails, we handle the complexity so that you can focus on what matters: driving innovation with the confidence that your data is safeguarded and sovereign.Our recent report,“Bridging the Gap: Hyperscalers and Verifiable Data Sovereignty with Opaque, Confidential AI Platform,”lays out some of the key differences between the offerings of hyperscalers and the offerings of Opaque Systems—underscoring the value of our comprehensive platform, designed for swift integration into existing workflows and software stacks.Related ContentShowing28GuardRail OSS, open source project, provides guardrails for responsible AI developmentThis is some text inside of a div block.GENERALRead MoreNo items found.Have a question about OPAQUE’s Confidential Computing Platform or want to see a live demo?Reach out hereCOMPANYHomeAboutResourcesCareersContactSOLUTIONSInsuranceFinanceHigh-TechContacthello@opaque.coLinkedInX (Formerly Twitter)© 2024 OPAQUE Systems, Inc.

    "content": "ResourcesBlogOvercoming Data Silos, Intellectual Property Risks, and Regulatory Compliance with Confidential AIByRishabh Poddar | Co-Founder and CTO2024-07-31•2 minutes ReadThe integration of AI in enterprise operations promises groundbreaking efficiencies and insights. However, harnessing the full potential of AI requires navigating acomplex landscape of data sharing challenges, which Karthik Narain, Group Chief Executive, Technology, Accenture explored at our recent Confidential Computing Summit.From Karthik’s assessment, and from our own industry expertise at Opaque Systems, we know there are several obstacles enterprises must address to unlock the full value of sensitive data with confidential AI: data silos, concerns about intellectual property damage, exploitation of AI by bad actors, and growing privacy regulations.A Solution to Power Sensitive Data UtilizationSensitive data often resides in legacy systems protected by stringent controls and regulations, making it difficult to use in modern AI applications. Collaboration—internally among departments and externally with partners or service providers—is often hindered, if not downright impossible.Model exposure also poses a new risk, potentially revealing training sets and insights into corporate strategies. Adversaries can exploit this by poisoning models or stealing them. Leaders are increasingly concerned about attackers using AI against their companies. Combined data sets can create unprecedented—and sometimes unauthorized—insights into consumer and business behavior, as demonstrated by a data search engine that exposed 26 billion records in the \"Mother of All Data Breaches.\"Meanwhile, regulations continue to emerge. Laws like DORA, GDPR, and the EU AI Act dictate how data must be collected, used, stored, and secured. Non-compliance can result in severe penalties, such as the fines imposed on Meta and Amazon forGDPR violations.Despite these challenges, it’s apparent that businesses can’t afford to let data go to waste. AI simply holds too much opportunity. Yet most traditionally employed data obfuscation and anonymization techniques like sanitization, redaction and tokenization are cost-prohibitive, time-consuming, or don’t verify processes.Additionally, they can increasingly be reverse-engineered by adversarial AI. Confidential AI, meanwhile, overcomes most of the challenges at the intersection of data sharing and artificial intelligence.The Promise of Confidential AIPreviously inaccessible data, trapped in silos, bound by regulations, or limited by corporate requirements, can now be put to work across industries, thanks to confidential AI. Confidential AI platforms, including theConfidential AI platform that our team at  Opaque Systems developed, ensure that AI models are trained and deployed within secure environments, preventing unauthorized access to training data and the models themselves. This means that sensitive datasets and proprietary algorithms are shielded from potential breaches.By encrypting data and models during processing, confidential AI prevents exposure of training sets, patterns, IP, and insights into corporate strategies. Even if a breach occurs, the encrypted data remains inaccessible and unintelligible to attackers. Confidential AI platforms can even include mechanisms to verify the integrity of AI models. This prevents adversaries from tampering with or poisoning models to distort their outputs. Any attempts to alter the models would be detected and mitigated.Ultimately, confidential AI enables secure collaboration between internal teams and external partners by sharing encrypted data. This ensures that proprietary information remains protected during joint AI development efforts.Embracing the Future with Confidential AIAs enterprises navigate the complexities of data sharing and AI integration, confidential AI emerges as a transformative solution. It can unlock exciting opportunities to leverage sensitive data securely, and successfully solve the key challenges of data silos, intellectual property risks, and regulatory compliance.Businesses can now harness the full potential of confidential AI, driving innovation,  gaining a competitive edge, and moving AI projects into production faster, while safeguarding their most valuable assets. Embracing confidential AI is not just a strategic advantage; it is a necessity in the evolving digital landscape.This article is inspired by presentations from Accenture at the Confidential Computing Summit.For more, view all sessions here.Related ContentShowing28GuardRail OSS, open source project, provides guardrails for responsible AI developmentThis is some text inside of a div block.GENERALRead MoreNo items found.Have a question about OPAQUE’s Confidential Computing Platform or want to see a live demo?Reach out hereCOMPANYHomeAboutResourcesCareersContactSOLUTIONSInsuranceFinanceHigh-TechContacthello@opaque.coLinkedInX (Formerly Twitter)© 2024 OPAQUE Systems, Inc.

    "content": "ResourcesBlogThe Mathematical Case for Trusted AI: Why Anthropic is All-In on Confidential ComputingByAaron Fulkerson | CEO2024-12-18•1 Minute ReadJason Clinton breaks down why AI's next frontier isn't just capability—it's verifiable trust.The season finale ofAI Confidentialarrives at a pivotal moment in AI's evolution—where questions of trust and verification have become existential to the industry's future.In this landmark episode, Anthropic CISOJason Clintonmakes a compelling case for why confidential computing isn't just a security feature—it's fundamentally essential to AI's future. His strategic vision aligns with what we've heard from other tech luminaries on the show, including Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich and NVIDIA's Daniel Rohrer: confidential computing is becoming the cornerstone of responsible AI development and is essential to the strategy at Anthropic.Jason's insights are particularly striking when considering Anthropic's position at the forefront of AI development. His detailed analysis of why Anthropic has identified confidential computing as mission-critical to their future operations speaks volumes about where the industry is headed. As he explains, achieving verifiable trust through attested data pipelines and models isn't just about security—it's about enabling the next wave of AI innovation.​​Let me build on Jason's points to underscore why this matters so deeply: Consider the probability of data exposure as AI systems multiply. Even with a seemingly small 1% risk of data exposure per AI agent, the math becomes alarming at scale. With 10 inter-operating agents, the probability of at least one breach jumps to 9.6%. With 100 agents, it soars to 63%. At 1,000 agents? The probability approaches virtual certainty at 99.99%. This isn't just theoretical—as organizations deploy AI agents across their infrastructure as \"virtual employees,\" these risks compound rapidly. The mathematical reality is unforgiving: without the guarantees that confidential computing provides, the danger becomes untenable at scale.Through this lens, Jason's insights reveal why confidential computing has moved from a \"nice-to-have\" to an absolute necessity for responsible AI development. And while Anthropic leads in developing transformative AI models, they recognize that the future demands more than just capability—it requires verifiable trust at every layer of the stack.As we wrap up this season of AI Confidential, what's clear is that confidential computing has moved beyond the exclusive domain of tech giants. While Apple builds Private Cloud Compute, Microsoft and Google construct their infrastructure on confidential computing foundations, we're (at OPAQUE) focused on democratizing these capabilities. Every enterprise deserves access to secure, trusted AI infrastructure—without the complexity of building custom confidential computing stacks. That's the future we're building, and your engagement with these critical discussions helps shape our vision of making confidential AI accessible to all.Related ContentShowing28GuardRail OSS, open source project, provides guardrails for responsible AI developmentThis is some text inside of a div block.GENERALRead MoreNo items found.Have a question about OPAQUE’s Confidential Computing Platform or want to see a live demo?Reach out hereCOMPANYHomeAboutResourcesCareersContactSOLUTIONSInsuranceFinanceHigh-TechContacthello@opaque.coLinkedInX (Formerly Twitter)© 2024 OPAQUE Systems, Inc.

    "content": "ResourcesBlogAI and Confidential Computing: A Virtuous Cycle of Value and InnovationByMarshall Kirkpatrick | Technology Journalist2024-07-15•2 minutes ReadThe rise of generative AI is driving huge demand for confidential computing. Confidential computing, in turn, is enabling big new opportunities for technical innovation in AI. These two themes were prominent among industry leaders at the 2nd annual Confidential Computing Summit.\"AI and generative AI are huge vectors of growth—enterprises have to at least experiment with these technologies,\" said Ion Stoica, UC Berkeley Professor, Executive Chairman of Anyscale, Executive Chairman of Databricks, and Board Member of Opaque Systems. \"In order to get value from generative AI, what enterprises have is their data.\"However, there is a major roadblock. Though sensitive data typically has more value, regulations are growing, limiting what types of data businesses are allowed to use and how they are allowed to use it.“The last time I looked, just across the United States, there are 700 bills that want to regulate AI in some shape or form,\" Stoica said. This growing regulatory burden is holding back enterprises from unlocking their data for AI innovation.Confidential computing provides a solution. \"You'll notice that OpenAI has actually put out a bounty for research projects on confidential computing in the generative AI space. Across the board, I'm hearing from OpenAI, Anthropic, and others that confidential computing is really important to all lines of their business,\" he explained. “As players like OpenAI and Anthropic increasingly rely on confidential computing for their lines of business, adoption, use, and implementation will grow.”\"Confidential computing will simply become pervasive,” Mark Papermaster, CTO and EVP of Technology and Engineering at AMD, added. “And AI will be the application that drives its broad adoption.\"Confidential Computing Unlocks AI Innovation for BusinessesIn financial services, regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and GLBA impose strict data privacy, security, and breach notification requirements to protect customer information. In high-tech industries, compliance with regulations such as HIPAA (for health data), GDPR, and industry-specific standards like PCI-DSS (for payment data) is critical to ensure data protection and privacy. But this protection comes at a cost. “The more constraints you have, the more you are going to put limits on innovation,\" Stoica said.Confidential computing removes these regulatory hurdles, effectively precluding any constraints.The vision is to be able to leverage data seamlessly without constraints, as Stoica describes: \"I want to do whatever I want today...on the encrypted data. That's the dream.\"Cloud providers will have an essential role to play in enabling this scalable vision: \"The cloud service providers are incredibly capable at running data centers, securing energy and access to compute chips,” Jason Clinton, Chief Information Security Officer at Anthropic, said. “Why invent the wheel when you can take advantage of that scale?\"For businesses to take advantage of that cloud innovation and to run AI on sensitive data, the essential step is confidential computing.Unleashing Business Data Drives More Powerful AIOnce data is unlocked through confidential computing, experts see opportunities to create smarter AI that can collaborate securely. Anthropic’s Clinton describes a future filled with sub-agents: “AIs calling other AIs using encrypted channels...dozens or hundreds of AI agents all working together to solve a very complex problem.\"But that’s impossible without the right protection in place, as investor Jeremiah Owyang pointed out. \"The only way AI agents can be everywhere and be effective is if they tap confidential, proprietary data. They're not doing it yet.\"Confidential computing is emerging as the key solution to unleash the full potential of generative AI by removing constraints on data usage while maintaining privacy and security. The opportunity is to drive a new wave of AI innovation that can transform every industry.Related ContentShowing28GuardRail OSS, open source project, provides guardrails for responsible AI developmentThis is some text inside of a div block.GENERALRead MoreNo items found.Have a question about OPAQUE’s Confidential Computing Platform or want to see a live demo?Reach out hereCOMPANYHomeAboutResourcesCareersContactSOLUTIONSInsuranceFinanceHigh-TechContacthello@opaque.coLinkedInX (Formerly Twitter)© 2024 OPAQUE Systems, Inc.
