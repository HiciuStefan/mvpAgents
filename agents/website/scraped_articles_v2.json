    "text": "Turning AI Into Practical Solutions\n\nAccenture is a global professional services company that helps businesses solve complex problems, using innovative solutions to help organizations adapt to today’s fast-changing business environment. Accenture stands out by making advanced technologies like AI usable in real-world settings. They provide full support to clients, from identifying key AI opportunities to building secure, scalable models that integrate smoothly into existing operations.\n\nWith the growing amount of sensitive data and the need for AI systems to work in multi-party environments, ensuring data security is a big challenge. To address these needs, Accenture leverages cutting-edge hardware like NVIDIA's H100 Tensor Core GPUs alongside OPAQUE's confidential computing technologies. This powerful combination enables businesses to safely implement AI projects while ensuring scalability, data privacy, and regulatory compliance.\n\n\"Through our collaboration with OPAQUE, we are empowering companies to navigate complex data landscapes with confidence, ensuring that privacy remains a priority even as they advance their capabilities.\"\n\nThe Challenge: Ensuring Data Privacy During AI Deployment\n\nTrusted AI depends on trusted data. Companies manage huge amounts of personal, financial, and proprietary data. As the data grows, securely analyzing it becomes essential—not only for maintaining customer trust and complying with legal requirements but also for unlocking the full value of data for insights. However, analyzing sensitive data, especially when shared between multiple parties, is a challenge. Strict regulations and technological limitations make it hard to collaborate securely. Data silos within organizations add to the problem, making it difficult to share and analyze data across departments or external partners. This results in missed opportunities and prevents businesses from fully leveraging AI. In industries with heavy regulation, the need to maintain data security while using AI becomes even more critical. Accenture needed a way to harness the power of large datasets while ensuring innovation and security were not compromised.\n\nThe Solution: Secure AI for Complex Data Environments\n\nTo address these issues, Accenture partnered with OPAQUE, whose platform allows multiple organizations to share and analyze sensitive data securely. OPAQUE's confidential AI technology ensures that data remains encrypted during processing, allowing organizations to collaborate without exposing or decrypting sensitive information. With this partnership, Accenture and its clients can confidently move AI projects into production, knowing that compliance and data security are maintained. This collaboration removes barriers that previously restricted the full use of valuable data.\n\n\"Our collaboration with OPAQUE has transformed how we support businesses in managing sensitive data. Using confidential AI technology, we are enabling companies to gain valuable insights and push the boundaries of what's possible in a responsible and forward-thinking manner.\"\n\nThe Results: Unlocking AI's Potential\n\nTelecommunications: Improved Data Sharing and Cyber Threat Response.\n\nAccenture works with leading telecommunications companies to help them share data securely across departments and with partners. OPAQUE's secure multi-party computation (SMPC) technology allows these companies to perform computations on encrypted data without exposing sensitive information. By partnering with OPAQUE, Accenture enables telecom providers to collaborate securely on tasks like fraud prevention and network optimization. For example, multiple telecom companies can combine their data to detect patterns of fraudulent activity, while ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations and keeping proprietary information protected.\n\n\"At Accenture, our focus is on driving innovation while adhering to the highest standards of security and compliance. With confidential AI technology, we can help industries access and leverage sensitive data that was previously out of reach, all while preserving data sovereignty and privacy.\"\n\n\"Our collaboration with OPAQUE has opened new opportunities for companies and reinforced trust in data ecosystems.\"\n\nEnhancing Know Your Customer (KYC) Programs\n\nIn the retail sector, Accenture helps clients securely analyze customer data without exposing sensitive information. By leveraging OPAQUE's confidential computing platform, Accenture enables retailers to collaborate with third-party partners or internal departments to gain deeper insights into customer behavior. This secure approach allows retailers to create more personalized marketing campaigns and improve the shopping experience. For instance, a retailer might work with a payment processor to analyze purchasing patterns, gaining valuable insights while ensuring individual customer privacy is maintained.\n\nConclusion: Innovation With Confidence\n\nBy integrating OPAQUE's technologies, Accenture has solved data protection challenges, enabling clients to innovate and grow while ensuring data security in an increasingly data-driven world.",
