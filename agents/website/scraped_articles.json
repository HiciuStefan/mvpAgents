From balancing decades-old legacy systems with ongoing cloud migrations, to adopting modern fintech innovations—all while staying compliant with regulations like the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX)—the challenges are multifaceted and relentless.\nMission-critical applications span core banking platforms like FIS, Fiserv, and Jack Henry, policy administration systems such as Guidewire and Duck Creek, customer-facing digital channels, and in house systems—both legacy and modern (Unqork, Outsystems). These systems must be fast, secure, reliable, and continuously evolving. That’s why testing in this industry must be equally agile, comprehensive, and resilient.\nYet, many organizations find themselves limited by current testing solutions—especially those rooted in web-based or open-source origins. These tools often fall short when supporting the variety of technologies that financial services institutions depend on, especially ‌legacy solutions that far outdate compatibility with newer fintech solutions. But most importantly, they lack the compliance rigor needed for such a tightly regulated industry.\nThis is where agentic automation platforms make a huge impact. By combining AI agents, resilient automated testing, and enterprise-ready compliance features, modern platforms empower financial services institutions to innovate confidently while mitigating risk.\nSo, what exactly are the world’s top financial services organizations looking for in a testing solution today?\nSeamless testing across legacy, migration, and emerging technologies\nFinancial services institutions often run a complex mix of technology—from legacy mainframes and thick-client systems to cloud native applications and fintech integrations. These systems don’t operate in isolation. They coexist, evolve, and must work seamlessly together.\nThe challenge? Ensuring functionality and security across all platforms as institutions modernize. Many testing providers can’t keep up.\nMany testing tools often:\nLack robust support for legacy systems such as mainframes and thick clients\nRequire manual workarounds or third-party tools to test anything beyond web or mobile apps\nStruggle to meet enterprise-level compliance and security requirements\nThat’s why leading financial institutions are turning to UiPath.\nAgentic testing with UiPath Test Cloud provides production-grade, end-to-end automated testing using intelligent AI agents. These agents adapt to evolving tech stacks, ensuring continuity and resilience across both legacy and modern applications—without compromise or complexity.\nBuilt for compliance and industry-specific regulations\nIn financial services, compliance is not optional.

Unlike traditional automation, agents can navigate complex processes, synthesize data from multiple sources, and adapt in real time, making them ideal for use cases such as operations monitoring, customer service, and knowledge management.\nUiPath low-code tools and prebuilt agent templates have democratized builder access across departments. But as use cases grow more sophisticated, custom agents built by professional developers are becoming a priority. Enterprises are looking for agents they can program with full code-level control that reflect their data, business rules, and systems architecture.\nThe rise of pro-code frameworks like LlamaIndex, LangChain, and CrewAI is making it easier to build agents that reason, plan, and interact with APIs and LLMs. Coding agents like Cursor and Claude Code further empower developers to quickly express complex logic and ship powerful agents. However, this new flexibility doesn’t negate the old truths; enterprises still need rigorous testing, secure deployment, human-in-the-loop oversight, and observability before anything hits production.\nUiPath coded agents for developers\nUiPath is meeting this enterprise shift with UiPath coded agents, which allow developers to easily create and deploy custom agents. Developers simply use the UiPath Python SDK to code an agent, package it using the UiPath CLI, and deploy within the UiPath infrastructure. A coded agent in UiPath is fully customizable, pulling data from enterprise systems, and making decisions using embedded rules or AI models. These agents can run on their own or operate as part of a broader agentic automation alongside other AI agents and robots. And crucially, they’re built with enterprise ops in mind: auditable, testable, and upgradable.\nCoded agents give developers:\nFull code-level control\n: define retries, decision trees, and integrations in Python via the UiPath SDK, with no low-code constraints or vendor lock-in\nModularity and reuse\n: package agents as shareable components for faster iteration across teams\nGovernance out of the box\n: role-based access control (RBAC), audit logs, and human-in-the-loop workflows are included\nSeamless deployment\n: with a single CLI command, AI agents can be packaged and deployed to UiPath Orchestrator for instant updates, rollback, or A/B testing\nSupport for the popular LlamaIndex agentic framework\nUiPath now offers full support for LlamaIndex’s open‑source agent framework and managed LlamaCloud, building on top of our\nexisting support for other pro-code frameworks.\nThis means developers can build agents using the open-source LlamaIndex tools they already love, then deploy them into UiPath’s enterprise-grade environment with minimal friction. The\nUiPath LlamaIndex SDK\nis open source, and we welcome community contributions.\nWith this integration, you can not only use LlamaIndex + LlamaCloud to build high-accuracy, deeply custom agents over your documents, but you can also plug directly into UiPath' s complex workflows, gaining enterprise-grade governance and observability alongside pro‑dev flexibility.\nJerry Liu, CEO, LlamaIndex\nProfessional developers get to build sophisticated agents in the powerful LlamaIndex agent framework, and UiPath handles the rest: deploying, orchestrating, monitoring, and securing those agents as part of mission-critical business processes.\nMark Geene, SVP of Product, UiPath\nGet started with coded agents\nExperience the benefits of integrating LlamaIndex agents and LlamaCloud into UiPath today:\nTry UiPath for free\nUiPath LlamaIndex quickstart guide\nUiPath LlamaIndex samples\nTopics:\nAgentic\nTaqi\nJaffri\nSenior Director, Product Management\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nProduct and Updates\nSeptember 9, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: Bridging traditional automation and agentic autonomy\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 12, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: How UiPath Maestro and REFramework work better together\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 5, 2025\nGoodbye workarounds: UiPath delivers native automation for macOS\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSubscribe\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSign up today and we'll email you the newest articles every week.\nThank you for subscribing!\nThank you for subscribing!

Its potential to connect areas of the enterprise that have struggled to communicate in the past, and reshape work as we know it, is incredibly exciting.\nIt can also be nerve-wracking.\nBefore implementing any new technology, business leaders want several questions answered:\nWhat’s the business case?\nHow do we measure success?\nWhat are others in our industry doing?\nBecause agentic automation is so new, these answers are still taking shape. But some organizations—including a number of\nUiPath Innovators\n—are further ahead than others. These trailblazers are part of a new program designed for business and transformation leaders committed to driving growth with AI and automation. And they’re starting to map out in detail what agentic automation will look like in their organizations.\nAfter talking to a number of UiPath Innovators, several patterns emerged, including common use cases and plans to track agentic impact. In this blog, we’ll unpack what’s top of mind for a growing group of leaders ready to move agentic automation from idea to impact.\nWhere AI agents are set to unlock enterprise value\nHelping systems and teams talk to each other\nDespite the countless SaaS tools and communication platforms that comprise modern enterprise tech stacks, many organizations have trouble getting disparate systems and teams on the same page. Different data formats, ways of doing things, and workflows create silos that inhibit the kind of collaboration that breeds innovation.\nUiPath Innovators have high hopes for agentic automation to break down these barriers and facilitate clearer information flows between people, systems, and robots. Manually bridging fragmented tools is a tall order, but agents have the intelligence and adaptability required to do so. This is a “big thing that’s top of mind” for Srinivas Nagarajan, previously at Deluxe, who believes that their organization can benefit from agentic automation’s ability to stitch together different systems and connect the underlying information.\nCustomer onboarding is an especially compelling use case for Deluxe.\nI’ve seen significant value on the onboarding side—especially in cases where we’re dealing with a complex customer setup. It’s not always just direct customer onboarding; we may also need to onboard resellers, direct sellers, and various channel partners. These scenarios often involve very different or even disconnected processes that need to be stitched together from a business perspective.\nSrinivas Nagarajan\nThere’s no shortage of business benefits to connecting disparate systems. In the public sector, subcontractor management can be a huge drain on time and resources. BDO’s Nicolas Sandros pointed to submitting multiple time entries through different systems as a particular pain point, and one that could be alleviated with the help of AI agents.\nUltimately, the common headache of translating information between people and systems is set to be alleviated with the arrival of AI agents.\nScaling operations without scaling headcount\nTraditionally, there has been a one-to-one relationship between headcount and goals: if you wanted to accomplish more as an organization, you needed to hire more people. But resources aren’t infinite, which has historically capped the number and scope of projects enterprises can take on.\nAgentic automation is changing this equation—forward-thinking organizations are already planning to leverage agents to accomplish certain goals without adding headcount. Areas like contact centers are particularly ripe for this kind of transformation.\nThe first area that we are focusing on is the contact center. What we've observed is a lot of the agent use cases of the heat map or generative AI shows high in the contact center/customer care use space regardless of what industry you come from.\nKarthik Ramakrishnan\n, Tapestry\nSimilarly, Ramakrishnan points to internal help desks as a great initial agentic use case, because agents can “help our employees get access to information quickly and efficiently.”\nBut it’s not just\ncall centers that can leverage AI agents\nto do more with the same amount of people. Some organizations, like Suncoast Credit Union, are thinking about how agents can accelerate their growth targets. Suncoast’s\nDottie Dunn\nsays the company is now asking “how many staff are we going to need to be able to double our members? We’re looking closely at the member to employee ratio.” Being able to amplify their impact with the same number of employees is the kind of big-picture thinking that lays the groundwork for significant ROI in these early agentic days.\nTurning data into proactive decisions\nBeing able to do more with less by stitching together systems and automating a wider range of tasks is a massive benefit of agentic automation. But its potential stretches even further, including by helping organizations turn raw data into useful business insights. This complex work of surfacing trends, risks, and other patterns leaves more bandwidth for business analysts to interpret these findings and use them to help leaders act faster.\nRamakrishnan expects this functionality to help Tapestry’s executives answer questions like “why was there a sales dip in these specific stores between yesterday and today, and what was the reason?”\nThis ability to diagnose patterns in real time and reason through them can also be applied to monitoring project risks. In field service, where delays and cost overruns can add up quickly, this will be especially beneficial.\nWe’ve just scratched the surface here of all the agentic use cases UiPath Innovators have expressed excitement about. But just as important as finding compelling uses is measuring their impact.\nHow UiPath Innovators are planning to track agentic impact\nUiPath Innovators aren’t just hoping for the best with agentic automation—they’re planning to track business impact in specific, actionable ways.\n1. Efficiency gains\nEver since the early days of\nrobotic process automation (RPA)\n, efficiency gains have been a tried-and-true automation benefit. That will continue with agentic automation—but in more wide-ranging ways. UiPath Innovators are planning to measure time savings with familiar, concrete criteria, such as reductions in average handle time (AHT) for service interactions.\n2. Cost savings\nPure monetary savings will always be an important barometer for executives. Ramakrishnan explained that, at Tapestry, agentic cost savings will be assessed in the form of deflection—having an agent perform a task rather than an employee doing it manually. That could be measured as dollars saved per minute or per contact, for example. The important thing is that “ROI is measurable and tangible.”\n3. Revenue impact\nTraditional automation has tended to focus on padding the bottom line by finding cost savings. But UiPath Innovators are realizing that agentic automation can have top-line impacts, too—if you know where to look.\nFor example, one UiPath Innovator shared that being able to provide faster delivery to customers is translating into new contracts.\nMove from insights to action with agentic automation\nThe energy around\nagentic automation\n, both within UiPath and among our customers and partners, is palpable. And it’s growing.\nUiPath Innovators are blazing the agentic trail—not just by automating more tasks, but by rethinking the way they work with connected systems, intelligent workflows, and a more efficient enterprise across the board.\nWe’re still in the early days, but the opportunity is clear: rather than waiting and seeing, organizations like these UiPath Innovators that start building an agentic framework now will be in prime position to deliver compelling ROI for years to come.\nUiPath is the agentic automation platform ready to support what’s next.\nTry it for free today\n.\nIf you missed the UiPath Agentic Automation Launch event, you can\nwatch the replay\n.\nRead next\n:\nWhat executives need to know about getting started with agentic automation\nWhat customers and partners are saying about the new UiPath Platform for agentic automation\nTopics:\nAgentic\nRetail\nFinance & Accounting (F&A)\nSupply chain\nAndrew\nSevillia\nDirector of Customer Marketing and Advocacy\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nAutomation\nAugust 25, 2025\nA message to business leaders: Gen Z is your AI advantage (if you let us be)\nAutomation\nFebruary 18, 2025\nGetting started with agentic automation: What executives need to know\nAutomation\nJanuary 9, 2025\nUI automation?

Traditionally, businesses fully depended on people to understand and process them, before their approach evolved to incorporate AI and automation. With the advent of\nAI agents\n—AI-based software entities able to plan, work, and make decisions independently—document-driven processes can now be automated end to end, freeing people for more important tasks.\nHowever, AI agents struggle with consistency and scale. Typical AI agents perform well when asked to understand and process a small number of simple documents. Yet, accuracy and performance degrade at an enterprise scale of hundreds, thousands, or even millions. Furthermore, complex documents—containing elements like embedded tables, graphs, and inferred values—can be a real challenge for agents to understand.\nIn this blog, I’ll explain why\nintelligent document processing\n(IDP) capabilities are the missing piece in the agentic automation of document-based processes. I’ll show how IDP enables AI agents to understand and process enterprise documents—consistently, accurately, at speed and scale.\nHow does IDP enhance agentic automation?\nAI agents are similar to real workers in that they need a lot of different tools to do their job well. Similarly, agents should call on a specific ‘tool’ when they encounter a complex document, or escalate to a human if no tool is available.\nAgents are most effective when they use tools that are tuned for a specific task. You can give a document to an agent and hope it extracts the right data each time. But the better option is to fine-tune an extractor and let the agent use it as a high precision tool for the task.\nThis is where IDP comes in.\nIDP solutions, like\nUiPath IXP\n(Intelligent Xtraction & Processing), provide important document processing capabilities that agents lack. They typically:\nOutput consistent, structured data that can be used in automations\nOffer tools to measure the accuracy and precision of AI models, how to gather ground-truth data, and how to compare different model versions\nProvide methods to quickly iterate and improve model performance and fine-tune the model at an individual field level\nProvide version controls for models, schemas, and prompts, etc.\nYou can see how IDP consistently and reliably extracts important data from even the most complex document types in this demo:\nAgents use IDP as a tool to accurately understand and process complex documents into structured, consistent data. It’s then easy for agents to use their reasoning capabilities to leverage the IDP output and complete the rest of the workflow.\nIDP is a vital tool in the toolbox of any agent that needs to process documents as part of its workflow. It reduces the need for manual document review and ensures document-based processes can run smoothly and largely autonomously.\nCan you use large language models for document processing?\nAn IDP solution is one of several tools an AI agent might call on to execute an E2E document-based process. However, could you replace an IDP ‘tool’ with a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT or Claude?\nAI models have typically required significant upfront training, with employees manually annotating many documents. However, the latest LLMs have shown strong performance in smaller use cases, using their native understanding and reasoning capabilities to extract the correct data with no training. Yet, larger enterprise-scale processes need much more rigor and reliability.\nIDP solutions are more than just LLMs. After all, a strong data extractor is just one component in a complete IDP solution. Enterprises must also consider:\nDigitization\nClassification\nSplitting packets and large documents\nExtraction (template, machine learning, generative AI)\nFine-tuning\nData validation and reinforcement learning\nModel hosting\nSystems integration and workflow processing\nAccess control\nSecurity\nGovernance and compliance\nLLMs excel at creative, unstructured work, but they struggle to maintain accuracy in the long term. If an agent calls on an LLM to extract specific information from a complex document, it might succeed on the first few attempts. However, mistakes are inevitable. It might hallucinate an incorrect output and, without monitoring capabilities, you have no way of knowing without manually reviewing every document. At that stage, you might as well be processing them all manually.\nIt’s also difficult to get consistent, structured outputs from LLMs. This usually takes many hours of trial-and-error prompt engineering, and even then, there’s no guarantee the model won’t hallucinate or deviate from the output you’ve asked for.\nChat-based LLMs are ideal for ad-hoc use, but out-of-the-box they don’t provide the confidence or reliability that an enterprise needs for high-volume repeatable document extraction without significant tuning. They excel in tasks where there’s a lot of flexibility and uncertainty involved, and you don’t always need a consistent output. But when you’re in a business setting, processing thousands of documents for the exact same goal, you really need reliable, repeatable, and structured outputs. The challenge is to turn models that are non-deterministic by their very nature; and turn them into more deterministic and predictable tools for repeatable processes.\nUiPath IXP: enabling agentic data extraction\nThe latest IDP solutions use one or more LLMs at their core. This may include external LLMs, but also, most importantly, specialized LLMs like\nUiPath DocPath and CommPath\n. These LLMs are specifically trained for data extraction from distinct formats like complex documents and communications. The latest IDP also provides many tools, integrations, and capabilities to increase the consistency and reliability of their outputs far beyond what a single LLM can do alone.\nUiPath IXP combines the best of LLM power and flexibility with the enterprise controls and guardrails of IDP. On the one hand, IXP lets you start processing complex documents straight away and with minimal prompting. At the same time, we provide lots of tools to help you define the structured output you want from the model consistently. These qualities make IXP an ideal tool for AI agents.\nIXP provides an inference-first training process. No training or prompt engineering is required to accurately extract useful data from complex unstructured documents right out of the box. This enables IXP to be rapidly deployed in agentic processes. Agents or users simply provide instructions (just like a prompt) to the model on what to extract and how it appears in the document.\nWhile interacting with UiPath IXP is similar to an LLM experience, a lot of post- and pre-processing happens behind the scenes to ensure a consistent data output. Strong control over the schema of these generative models is also provided. We allow you to create your own ‘field groups’ specifying the exact information you want to extract. The output is the exact format needed for AI agents to use the resulting structured data to execute document-based processes and create value.\nLastly, UiPath IXP accounts for AI model mistakes by providing precise controls to ensure the accuracy of outputs. UiPath IXP makes validation easy through our new Validation Experience. Our models give confidence scores for every prediction which, in combination with other business checks, can be used to trigger manual reviews when needed. This way, uncertain predictions are reviewed and corrected by humans in the loop, ensuring AI agents work with high-quality, accurate data from documents.\nFor these reasons, IXP will be a native tool in\nUiPath Agent Builder\n, our unified tool for building, testing, and deploying AI agents across the enterprise. When building their own AI agent, users can add IXP to their agent’s ‘toolbox’ allowing it to easily leverage the right capability for document processing tasks, whether structured, semi-structured, or complex and unstructured. Enterprises using UiPath Agent Builder and IXP can stand up powerful document process automations quickly, and which are fine-tuned to their exact business needs.\nSummary\nAgentic automation\nenables the automation of complex business processes, but their effectiveness depends on access to reliable, structured data—especially when documents are involved.\nIDP provides an ideal solution, enabling agents to interpret and act on documents with consistency, accuracy, and control. UiPath IXP improves on standard LLM performance by combining flexible AI with enterprise-grade validation, schema control, and integration. By tooling agents with IXP, you eliminate the need for complex prompt engineering and up-front training, and enable agents to extract value from your documents with accuracy and determinism.\nAs enterprises scale agentic automation into document-heavy processes, IDP will be a vital tool in the agent’s toolbox for ensuring robustness and reliability.

That was the energy coursing through every keynote, demo, and hallway chat at UiPath DevCon in Bengaru, India, April 30. (If you missed the live event, you can\ncatch up on all sessions May 14 at DevCon Online\n.)\nAcross DevCon sessions, we highlighted the\n10 most powerful UiPath innovations\nthat enable the UiPath Platform™ to lead the way into the agentic age.\nLet’s unpack those innovations, explore how each pushes the boundary of what’s possible, and examine how it all fits into the larger vision of\nagentic automation\n.\nWelcome to agentic automation era\nRobots gave us technology to emulate how people do repetitive work. With agentic automation, this is the first time in history we have access to technology that starts to truly emulate the human mind. The agentic automation platform we built unifies AI, RPA, and human decision making so companies can deliver smarter, more resilient workflows without added complexity. As models and chips commoditize, the value of AI moves up the stack to orchestration and intelligence. That’s where UiPath leads.\nDaniel Dines\n, Founder and CEO, UiPath\nTraditional robotic process automation (RPA) gave enterprises a great head start, but real-world business processes have become more complex and multi-system, needing greater contextual understanding and adaptive decision making to run smoothly. That’s why UiPath has added AI agents to the mix.\nAI agents\nwork alongside robots and people. They reason, learn, and act on their own—but should always remain within clear guardrails.\nAgentic automation has arrived. And like RPA before it, what once seemed impossible is now ready for deployment. Not in some distant future, but here and now.\nLet’s look at the powerful UiPath innovations making agentic automation possible\ntoday\n.\n10 UiPath innovations defining the agentic future\n1. UiPath Maestro™\nEnterprises can unlock enormous value by simplifying and streamlining their processes with agentic automation. However, they need a careful, orchestrated approach that mitigates the risks and ensures AI agents are introduced to critical processes in a secure and scalable way—all while driving real business outcomes.\nAgentic automation needs an orchestration layer to enhance visibility, reduce complexity, and responsibly manage agentic processes. We call this agentic orchestration.\nThe linchpin of agentic orchestration,\nUiPath Maestro\nenables seamless end-to-end processes involving agents, robots, and people. It's the first orchestration layer built from the ground up for agentic processes, with native support for multi-agent environments (spanning UiPath, LangChain, CrewAI, and Salesforce).\nIrrespective of which platform the agents or automations were built on, or which AI models they are using, with Maestro, every business can now model, operate, and optimize its processes like a well-tuned symphony involving multiple agents and robots. And people are always in the loop as ‌leaders, coordinators, and ultimate decision makers.\n2. UiPath Agent Builder and coded agents\nUiPath Agent Builder\nis a new low-code experience within Studio Web for creating, testing, and deploying AI agents within the UiPath ecosystem. It enables the creation of agents that leverage business data through context grounding, powerful tools (including existing automations, agents, activities, and API workflows), and even natural language-based agent building with UiPath Autopilot™. Agent Builder empowers developers to create specialized AI agents that seamlessly integrate into orchestrated workflows across various systems. These agents utilize features such as tool guardrails, escalation paths, and agent scoring to ensure reliability and auditability.\nCoded agents—or agents written in Python with some of our great partners like\nLangGraph\n—can now be packaged, published, and run from UiPath Orchestrator. UiPath supports an open ecosystem of UiPath agents, coded agents, people, and robots all working together to help our customers achieve their\nagentic orchestration\ngoals.\n3. UI automation for macOS\nTo achieve transformational value with agentic automation, access to all enterprise data is a must-have. Every user, regardless of the platform they are using, also needs democratized access to automations that can transform their workflows.\nOur industry-leading UI automation is now available for macOS. Users can build, test, and debug enterprise-grade automations with Studio Web—natively on Mac. They can also automate native macOS apps (e.g., Numbers, Pages, Mail), Microsoft Office applications (e.g., Excel), and any Java applications (e.g., SAP GUI). This enables organizations to efficiently scale their automation programs and bring automation to every Mac user.\n4. Data Fabric\nImagine having instant access to all your enterprise data—no matter where it's stored—without having to copy, move, or manually stitch it together. That’s the promise of UiPath Data Fabric. It creates a virtualized data layer across your fragmented systems, enabling seamless and consistent access to data across applications and environments.\nData Fabric delivers real-time integration, making data instantly available where it’s needed—without duplication. This “zero-copy” architecture not only reduces storage costs but also breaks down data silos that slow innovation. With built-in governance, access control, and auditability, Data Fabric ensures your data remains secure, compliant, and trusted—making it a game-changer for modern enterprises aiming to be agentic and data-driven.\n5. API workflows\nThis purpose-built API-first canvas enables developers to build fast, scalable, multi-step workflows using APIs. These workflows abstract complex logic and enable agents to work seamlessly across systems via composite services.\nWorkflows adjust based on real-time data and contextual understanding, driven by agentic decision making. They also facilitate human-in-the-loop exception management and agent testing for enhanced validation of autonomous automations.\n6. UiPath Autopilot™ for Developers\nAutopilot for Developers is a built-in conversational AI agent that lets developers turn their thoughts into an automation. Thanks to our latest enhancements, now available in public preview, developers can use natural language to create and edit workflows, business processes, and agents—transforming high-level descriptions into detailed automation steps. They can also benefit from contextual AI-driven suggestions to fix errors in real time, use documentation and web search to get guidance and resources tailored to their workflow's context, and quickly troubleshoot issues using the built-in UiPath knowledge base.\nWith the new Autopilot, developers can build automation solutions faster and more efficiently, all within our unified developer experience.\n7. Agentic testing\nAgentic testing\nis a revolutionary approach to software testing where AI agents—including UiPath Autopilot for Testers as well as custom-built agents—augment testers’ expertise to supercharge testing. This new methodology enhances the testing process by incorporating AI-powered capabilities such as automated test case generation, test result analysis, and natural language search for complex queries.\nWith its ability to streamline and accelerate the entire testing lifecycle, agentic testing is poised to transform the way organizations approach software quality assurance, making testing more efficient, effective, and enjoyable.\n8. Healing Agent\nWe're excited to share that Healing Agent is now generally available. It offers intelligent self-healing to ensure UI automations continue running uninterrupted, even when unexpected application changes occur. It also provides actionable recommendations for fixing automation issues—without the need for further troubleshooting or debugging. Healing Agent enables organizations to enhance their automation efficiency, while reducing their maintenance efforts and downtime cases.\n9. UI Agent\nUI Agent is a natural language-driven agent that understands user intent, plans multi-step tasks, and autonomously executes actions across interfaces. Think of it as the full self-driving engine for UI automation. It complements traditional RPA by blending structured logic with intuitive, semantic capabilities. RPA is the logical \"left brain,\" ideal for predictable tasks, while UI Agent acts as the intuitive \"right brain,\" adept at handling dynamic and unpredictable environments.\nThis combination can significantly lower total cost of ownership (TCO) by enhancing resilience and reducing development complexity. Automations that previously required intricate logic can now easily interact with dynamic data and complex UI elements through natural language. Additionally, UI Agent unlocks entirely new automation scenarios, powered by the semantic cognitive engines behind large action models (LAMs).\nOur ‘best of both worlds’ approach ensures you benefit from both the predictability of structured robotic automation and the flexible, semantic intelligence associated with AI agents.\n10. UiPath IXP\nThe vast majority of business context is trapped within complex and unstructured data types. AI agents will need a consistent, reliable means to access all enterprise data at speed and scale.\nUiPath IXP (Intelligent Xtraction and Processing) is a multimodal data classification and extraction experience that unlocks enterprise data. It brings together our existing, and category-leading IDP capabilities—document understanding and communications mining—with a new prompt-driven capability for unstructured and high-complexity documents called generative extraction. UiPath IXP is built for fast time to value and a seamless user experience, turning all document and communications data into insight and action at speed and scale.\nMore than new innovations, agentic is a new way of thinking about automation\nAt DevCon it was clear: this isn’t just a new chapter for automation—it’s a new mindset.\nTwo key ideas stood out:\nWorkflows are now living systems\nWith the introduction of UiPath Maestro and the redesigned workflow engine, UiPath is rethinking how automation is built and run. Agentic orchestration truly brings the best of the UiPath Platform™ together; it’s a single canvas, a single artifact, for you to define and design your business process.\nThat single canvas includes AI agents, robots, people, and APIs—all operating in sync, all fully observable. You can now design and manage processes that adapt in real time, with every decision, action, and outcome traceable and easy to refine.\nOpen ecosystems, grounded in trust, are key\nAgentic automation isn’t about locking you into any particular tools or platforms. It’s about giving you flexibility with control. UiPath Maestro can orchestrate agents from UiPath, LangChain, CrewAI, Salesforce, and others, all in the same flow.\nAs I explained at DevCon, the cool thing about agents is it’s easy to build demos. The hard and tricky thing is to convert them into things that actually work in production.\nThat’s where the UiPath AI Trust Layer, agent scoring, built-in governance, and security controls come in. You can scale agents confidently—because every one of them is monitored, evaluated, and accountable.\nWhere we go from here\nThe agentic future is no longer a concept. It’s here, and it’s running in production.\nOn May 14,\njoin us for DevCon Online\n—we’ll be bringing you all the sessions from our in-person event in Bengaluru, India, plus some exclusive online-only sessions. You’ll get to see these powerful UiPath innovations in action throughout the half-day virtual event.\nTopics:\nIntelligent document processing\nAgent Builder\nAgentic orchestration\nAutopilot\nAgentic\nAPI\nRaghu\nMalpani\nRelated articles\nProduct and Updates\nSeptember 9, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: Bridging traditional automation and agentic autonomy\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 12, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: How UiPath Maestro and REFramework work better together\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 5, 2025\nGoodbye workarounds: UiPath delivers native automation for macOS\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSubscribe\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSign up today and we'll email you the newest articles every week.\nThank you for subscribing!\nThank you for subscribing!

Yet for many organizations, this promise remains frustratingly elusive.\nDespite investing significant resources in automation development, teams can find themselves devoting significant resource to maintenance cycles, troubleshooting, and firefighting when their automations struggle with new elements like UI changes.\nUiPath Healing Agent\nrepresents a fundamental shift in how to enhance UI automation resilience. By combining AI-powered recovery strategies with deterministic logic, it transforms rules-based automation into adaptive, self-healing systems that continue running even while applications evolve around them.\nThe result is a new paradigm where automation maintenance evolves from reactive to proactive, and robots become truly autonomous rather than depending on human intervention.\nThe hidden cost of fragile automations\nUI automation\nhas historically been challenging due to the dynamic nature of modern applications. User interfaces constantly evolve—labels get renamed, buttons move, new pop-ups appear, and layouts shift to accommodate new features. These changes, while often minor from a user perspective, can be highly disruptive for automation scripts that rely on precise element identification.\nAccording to EY’s comprehensive study, 30% to 50% of initial automation projects fail to meet their intended objectives. This failure rate represents a significant issue for organizations investing in automation technologies, with the primary causes stemming from the inherent brittleness of traditional automation approaches.\nOne of the most significant challenges facing\nrobotic process automation\n(RPA) implementations is the maintenance burden that accompanies robot deployment. Forrester research shows that over 50% of RPA projects can’t grow beyond ten robots, with scalability challenges directly linked to the maintenance overhead that increases exponentially as automation portfolios grow.\nUI changes are the primary cause of robot failures, with selector-based automation particularly vulnerable to modifications in application structure. When applications undergo updates, the element selectors that robots rely on can become invalid, causing automation scripts to fail until manual intervention resolves the issue.\nThe financial impact of these failures extends beyond direct maintenance costs. Robot repair times can range from a few hours to days and even weeks, depending on the complexity of the issue and the availability of documentation. During this downtime, business processes that depend on automation must revert to manual execution, eliminating the efficiency gains that automation was designed to provide.\nIntroducing UiPath Healing Agent: a revolutionary approach\nUiPath Healing Agent addresses these fundamental challenges through a sophisticated self-healing approach, combining AI with deterministic recovery strategies. Rather than simply logging failures and stopping execution, Healing Agent actively analyzes problems in real time and applies the most appropriate recovery methods to keep automation running.\nThe agent operates on just-in-time (JIT) analysis, performing real-time examination of UI elements and application state at the moment of failure. This approach allows Healing Agent to understand not just what went wrong, but why it went wrong and what alternatives are available. The system maintains a comprehensive understanding of the automation's intent, enabling it to make intelligent decisions about how to proceed when the original plan encounters obstacles.\nIntelligent recovery strategies form the core of Healing Agent's capabilities. When a selector fails, the system doesn't simply retry the same approach—it analyzes the current UI state, identifies alternative elements that match the original intent, and dynamically updates the automation to use the most appropriate option.\nThe system's dual-mode operation provides both immediate recovery and long-term improvement. In self-healing mode, Healing Agent automatically applies fixes and continues execution, ensuring business continuity. In recommendation mode, it captures detailed information about failures and suggests specific fixes that developers can review and apply to prevent future occurrences. Lastly, semantic understanding enables Healing Agent to recognize when UI elements have changed in meaning rather than just appearance. For example, if a label changes from \"First Name\" to \"Given Name,\" the system understands these represent the same concept and adjusts accordingly.\nTo understand how these capabilities work together, watch how Healing Agent helps recover an unintended automation:\nHow Healing Agent works: the technology behind self-healing\nThe technical architecture of UiPath Healing Agent represents a significant advancement in automation resilience. The system employs multiple complementary technologies to achieve robust self-healing capabilities. Our multi-strategy recovery engine serves as the foundation of Healing Agent's intelligence. When an automation encounters a failure, the system evaluates multiple strategies simultaneously and selects the most appropriate one based on the specific failure context:\nSelector regeneration\n: when element attributes change, Healing Agent analyzes the current UI structure and generates new selectors that maintain the same targeting intent while adapting to the new element properties\nSemantic targeting\n: the system leverages natural language processing to understand when labels or descriptions have changed meaning while maintaining the same functional purpose\nComputer vision fallback\n: if traditional selector-based approaches fail, Healing Agent can switch to image-based recognition using screenshots captured during the original automation development\nIntelligent wait strategies\n: rather than using fixed timeouts, the system dynamically adjusts wait times based on observed application behavior and current performance conditions\nObstruction management addresses one of the most common causes of automation failure—unexpected pop-ups, overlays, and modal dialogs. Healing Agent intelligently categorizes these obstructions and applies appropriate handling strategies. Furthermore, cascade recovery processing enables Healing Agent to apply multiple recovery strategies in sequence when complex failures occur. For example, it might first close an interfering pop-up, then adjust a selector, and finally apply a smart delay to wait for page loading—all in a single recovery cycle.\nHow Healing Agent enhances automation\nThe advantages of Healing Agent extend far beyond simple failure recovery. It fundamentally changes how organizations approach automation design, deployment, and maintenance.\nProactive automation design\n: teams no longer need to anticipate every possible UI variation. Developers can focus on core business logic rather than defensive programming, knowing that Healing Agent will handle unexpected changes gracefully.\nEarlier automation adoption\n: organizations feel confident that their automation investments won't become maintenance burdens. Teams can begin automating processes earlier in application development cycles, knowing that UI changes won't immediately break their work.\nEnhanced scalability\n: automation programs are no longer limited by maintenance capacity. Organizations can deploy more automations across more processes without proportionally increasing support requirements.\nRisk mitigation\n: automation becomes more predictable and reliable. Business processes that depend on automation experience fewer disruptions, leading to better service levels and reduced operational risk.\nIntegration with existing automation frameworks\nOne of Healing Agent's key strengths is its seamless integration with existing UiPath automation investments. Organizations don't need to rebuild their automation portfolios to benefit from self-healing capabilities.\nBackwards compatibility ensures that existing automations can benefit from Healing Agent capabilities with minimal modification. The system works with current UiPath projects by simply updating the UI Automation Activities package and enabling Healing Agent at the process level.\nGovernance integration allows organizations to maintain control over healing behaviors through the UiPath AI Trust Layer. Administrators can configure whether Healing Agent should automatically apply fixes or only provide recommendations, ensuring alignment with organizational risk tolerance and compliance requirements.\nFinally, monitoring and analytics provide comprehensive visibility into healing activities through UiPath Insights. Organizations can track healing success rates, identify patterns in failures, and optimize their automation designs based on real-world performance data.\nThe future of resilient automation\nUiPath Healing Agent represents more than just a feature enhancement—it’s an evolution of how we conceptualize and implement automation. It demonstrates that automation can be both powerful and resilient, autonomous and controlled, sophisticated and reliable.\nThe complexity of modern approaches continues to increase, UIs become more dynamic, and the pace of change accelerates.

This blog explains why LLMs alone aren’t sufficient for end-to-end document processing, and provides a look at the work UiPath is doing to address the underlying limitations of the LLM- or VLM-led approach.\nThe pitfalls of using LLMs for document extraction and processing\nLLMs are a transformative technology with immense business value. However, they have specific limitations that curtail their utility in enterprise-level, intelligent document processing (IDP) and related automations.\nUiPath researchers have spent the last six months stress-testing various LLMs, evaluating hundreds of document use cases while building additional capabilities on top of them. From this research, we’ve identified two major issues:\n1. Dead-ends\nSome problems simply can’t be solved through prompting alone. Whether this involves an LLM’s core extraction capability or its performance on a specific field, table, or document, we’ve found that no amount of prompting can generally solve these problems at scale. With an exclusively prompt-based solution, this can lead to frustrating experiences we describe as a ‘dead-ends.’ Throughout our model stress-testing, we’ve encountered multiple dead-ends and are implementing different strategies to remove them:\nTable extraction is one area where we've seen significant problems. Foundational LLMs frequently make mistakes like skipping rows, mixing up columns and rows, or extracting data where it's missing.\nFortunately, we’ve been able to solve this problem through our new model for complex and unstructured documents in\nUiPath IXP\n. The solution is built around intelligent pre-processing, plus a combination of different models, including UiPath computer vision models, LLMs for table recognition, and LLMs for extraction. This ability to determine the right combination of technologies for a given use case yields a powerful advantage for enterprises compared with just using an LLM directly.\nTo illustrate, here’s a summary of performance across a sample of challenging document types:\nAverage Field F1 Score\nDocument Type\nImage Only\nEnhanced Table Extraction V1\nEnhanced Table Extraction V2\nPaystubs/pay slips\n73.4%\n79.7%\n85.4%\nInsurance renewal documents\n90.4%\n95.1%\n98.5%\nOur approach results in a significant improvement, allowing customers to accelerate their time to production and start extracting value more quickly.\nIn our experimentation, we’ve experienced similar issues with document elements like checkboxes and signatures. Improving extraction accuracy and performance for these tasks is a key priority for our team.\n2. Automation readiness\nWith simple documents and just one or a small number of samples, it's very easy for an LLM to get an accurate extraction—at first glance. However, seeing fields extracted in a chat experience is not sufficient for automation. You need to drive consistency in the structured schema that's extracted, and you need data typing to ensure the data is in the correct format for your automation.\nThis is where the motivation to create\nUiPath IXP (Intelligent Xtraction & Processing)\nbegan. We wanted to provide a simple experience for users to construct automation-ready schemas and prompts, and quickly iterate to drive improvements in extraction. However, to actually use these within the automation of a business process and at scale, you need even more.\nTwo other critically important capabilities are\nattribution\nand\nconfidences\n:\nAttribution\nAttribution, or references/citations, is key when automating a process. Attribution is how a model shows a user where a given field has been extracted from a document. Because human review remains necessary to automate important documents at scale, it’s critical to provide clear attribution for model outputs. Without it, a user would need to manually review the entire document, which defeats the purpose of automation.\nFoundational LLMs do not provide reliable attribution and have been shown to erroneously invent citations in many cases. A lack of reliable attribution limits the utility of LLMs in document processing. UiPath IXP overcomes this challenge as attribution for foundation models has been built into the core experience. It’s also a part of the experience we’re continually iterating and improving on.\nConfidences\nConfidences—the degree to which a person can trust a specific output from a model—are critical for ensuring human-in-the-loop review is both effective and efficient. Users need a simple metric to help them decide whether a model output should be reviewed by a human. The only alternative is manually reviewing everything.\nSome foundational models output log probabilities (logprob), which can be used to return confidences. However, while directionally informative, they don’t provide the beautifully smooth precision recall curves typical of traditional models.\nOur main takeaway is that the standard logprob approach isn’t ideal. It's possible to make more requests to get more useful confidences that are better at distinguishing between good and bad predictions, but this is significantly more resource-intensive. While confidences are important, users also need to perform tasks like building validation rules on top of extractions—such as applying mathematical checks and regular expressions—to ensure outputs are accurate and automation-ready. We’re currently building features into UiPath IXP to make these a core part of the experience, while also developing better ways to provide more useful confidences.\nIn-context/few-shot learning\nAnother technique we’ve explored: using annotated examples in model prompts to improve performance—an approach known as ‘in-context’ or ‘few-shot’ learning. However, to date, the results have been mixed. Where the content is generally short (like emails), we’ve seen that if you provide relevant examples, you can significantly improve performance. We’ve also found that in-context learning is effective for making targeted improvements, like when there are extraction issues on a specific table in a complex document.\nHowever, in-context learning also has its drawbacks. First, it can lead to ‘overfitting’ by the model, as it applies the same behavior to similar tables in the document. And we haven’t yet seen strong results on longer document types.\nThe wider research community has found that in-context learning with VLMs doesn’t yield comparable results with text-based models—but our research here continues.\nA roadmap for end-to-end document automation\nUiPath uses foundational LLMs extensively in its intelligent document processing (IDP) capabilities, whether behind-the-scenes to accelerate customer time to value, or up front as the model for extraction. We’re continually building our own solutions on top of state-of-the-art technologies specialized for targeted use cases, while providing support and access to the latest frontier models.\nHowever, we don’t assume LLMs alone will solve the many challenges of document processing. LLMs aren’t trained specifically on enterprise documents, or for the many different use cases required by our customers. Furthermore, LLM providers aren't prioritizing the improvement of attribution or confidences in document processing. That’s why UiPath researchers and engineers have developed a multi-pronged strategy to tackle these issues:\nTrain and extend our own fine-tunable models for complex and unstructured documents;\nImprove our pre- and post-processing capabilities to supplement foundational models; and\nContinuously evaluate additional LLMs and make recommendations for different use cases.\nWe’ve already made good progress on our first objective and will announce more advances in the near future. In addition, we’ve taken significant strides in our pre- and post-processing capabilities, which will remain a key area of research and investment. Next up, we’ll address performance issues when extracting from checkboxes and signatures. We’ll also continue our efforts to improve attribution for LLMs, following an iterative process where we find edge-cases and release improvements over time.\nLastly, we’re making it easier for UiPath users to bring in more models for their specialized document processing tasks, while giving them a holistic experience to quickly evaluate models’ performance and scale them. Our approach will help our users adapt to changing conditions while also providing a mechanism to try alternate models for specific use cases.\nUltimately, we'll need all three of these strategies to deliver more accurate and reliable extraction across all document and content types. Our goal is to combine methods and technologies to provide the best performance for our customers and their unique use cases. UiPath IXP will evolve to intelligently orchestrate and combine multiple models—selecting the most effective approach for each document processing task—while incorporating the latest advances in pre- and post-processing.\nWant to learn more about our open and flexible approach to document processing?\nVisit our capability page and begin your trial\nof our new generative extraction for complex and unstructured capability.

Legacy systems, fragmented workflows, and the sheer volume of claims contribute to backlogs, provider friction, and rising costs. In an environment where every claim is a moment of truth for member and provider trust, the pressure to evolve is real.\nEnter:\nagentic automation\n—a new wave of intelligent, self-directed automation that doesn’t just follow rules, but actively makes decisions, adapts to complexity, and transforms how payers handle claims from end to end.\nWhy are payments so painful?\nIn a perfect world, the payments process would be streamlined, efficient, and error-free. But unfortunately, in the real world, it's highly complex, variable, and error-prone. Where are the pain points?\nFirst, there’s the nature of the decisions themselves. Many require analyzing a significant amount of data—some of it unstructured or semi-structured—gathered from many different sources. These decisions aren't always straightforward and rule based; they require judgment, experience, and context to get right.\nSecond, most payments providers also must contend with legacy systems and siloed data that reduce flexibility, slow processes, and hamper informed decision making.\nThird, ever-increasing volume and complexity of claims—coupled with ongoing shortages of skilled claims processing labor—creates stubborn backlogs and bottlenecks that lead to more complexity and employee burnout.\nAll this leads to ongoing operational challenges, including:\nDelays due to manual validation, outdated rules engines, and siloed data\nHigh error rates and rework from legacy tech and human intervention\nProvider dissatisfaction due to late payments and lack of transparency\nHigh operational costs and workforce burnout\nInability to scale with new lines of business or value-based care models\nManual interventions for validation and exception handling\nDifficulty in getting data to make informed, real-time decisions\nHigh costs due to rework, audits, and slow resolutions\nIn a nutshell, today’s payment claims systems weren’t built for tomorrow’s healthcare ecosystem. How can they escape from this conundrum?  Agentic automation provides the pathway.\nHow agentic automation helps address the claims conundrum\nAgentic automation has the potential to transform claims systems by allowing a great deal more of the process to be automated. To understand why and how, let's dive a little more deeply into the subject.\nAgentic automation represents a new generation of AI-powered systems—goal-driven AI agents—that can go far beyond simple task execution. Unlike traditional RPA robots that require step-by-step instructions, these AI agents operate with autonomy. They don’t just follow workflows—they optimize them, with advanced capabilities to:\nUnderstand and set goals based on natural language prompts\nPerceive context\nMake decisions\nAdapt to dynamic environments\nLearn from outcomes\nWork effectively with tools and models, as well as people and robots, to execute work\nIn the claims world, that means AI agents can understand nuances in clinical documentation, apply policy rules in real time, coordinate across departments, audit intelligently, and resolve exceptions with minimal human intervention. Couple these capabilities with an automation platform that provides end-to-end orchestration, full governance and trust, rapid access to superior tools and resilient robots—and you have a pathway to transform the payment process, end to end.\nThis is not just theory. It’s already happening.\nPutting agentic automation to work: three use cases to consider first\nSome of our customers have already put agentic automation to work, with impressive results. Here are three examples of use cases that have generated rapid and significant improvements.\n1. Pended claims automation\nPended claims—that is, claims requiring additional information before they can be processed—are a significant cause of delays and payment disruptions. By automating this process, one of our customers,\nExpion Health\n, has achieved a 600% improvement in throughput and a 99% success rate in claims resolution.\nKey benefits:\nFaster claims processing\nReduced delays and bottlenecks\nImproved payment accuracy\nReduced cost per claims\n2. Claims audit automation\nManual audits are time-consuming and prone to errors. Automation captures claims, extracts data, and identifies discrepancies, allowing for faster, more accurate and robust audits. For example, a Regional Blue Plan reduced audit times from 3.5 hours to minutes, dramatically increasing audit capacity and ensuring accurate claims.\nKey benefits:\nFaster, more accurate audits\nSignificant time savings\nReduced overpayments\n3. Appeals and grievances automation\nAs the healthcare ecosystem becomes more complex, appeals volume has been increasing—putting even more pressure on manual approaches and increasing customer-dissatisfying delays and backlogs. One of our customers is applying automation to streamline the process from intake to rendering a decision and notifying the provider/member. The result: a 75% reduction in turnaround times.\nKey benefits:\nFaster turnaround times and decisions\nReduced administrative burden; research, follow up, and processing time\nCompliance and SLA adherence\nThese are three use cases that have delivered proven, accelerated results for UiPath customers—and therefore are ones that you might wish to prioritize in your own efforts. But they are certainly not the only applications for agentic automation in payments. Others places you might consider leveraging AI agents include:\nClaims load and cleanup\nPended claims review and resolution\nPrepayment pricing validation\nCorrespondence generation\nOverpayment recoveries\nCoordination of benefits (COB) research and determination\nClaims testing\nClaims audit\nConfiguration monitoring\nOne thing is clear: as claims volumes and complexity grow, agentic automation will play an even more vital role in streamlining operations. It will enhance decision making with automation tools and further improve efficiency across the entire claims lifecycle, from intake to adjudication.\nConclusion: The path to efficient claims management\nTraditional claims management methods are no longer sustainable. With growing claims volumes and increasing complexity, payers need a more efficient way forward. Agentic automation provides the tools to transform the claims process—reducing costs, enhancing accuracy, and speeding up processing.\nTopics:\nHealthcare\nAgentic\nJason\nBui\nHead of Payer Solutions\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nIndustry Solutions\nJuly 21, 2025\nAgentic, not fragmented: how AI agents unify the contact center\nIndustry Solutions\nMay 21, 2025\nStill running AI agents and RPA in silos in financial services?

The question facing enterprises today isn’t if AI is essential for software testing, but how fast you can make it work for your software testers and quality engineers.\nOne of the fastest and most effective ways to put AI into the hands of your software testing teams is agentic testing. Agentic testing is a new approach that leverages AI agents—AI-based software entities able to perceive their environments, process information, and take actions to achieve specific objectives.\nIn this blog post, I’ll explain why agentic testing is the next evolution of software testing: AI-powered, integrated, and purpose-built for modern, fast-paced software development. I’ll also show how UiPath delivers the gamut of both out-of-the-box AI agents and custom AI agents through\nUiPath Test Cloud\n.\nWhat is agentic testing?\nAgentic testing\nmeans augmenting software testers with AI agents across all phases of testing to not only accelerate and simplify their work but to unlock what they couldn’t do before. It's AI that works with you, not instead of you.\nTesting agents don’t just execute scripts; they understand goals. They assist testers in quality-checking requirements, generating test cases, automating manual test cases, and providing real-time, actionable insights into test results. These agents act with autonomy and intelligence, responding to the broader, messier, and a lot less predictable challenges that are becoming increasingly common in modern quality assurance (QA) environments.\nAgentic testing elevates software testers. It hands off repetitive but context-heavy tasks to AI agents so teams can focus on more strategic tasks in testing.\nUiPath Test Cloud: built for testers, powered by AI agents\nTo accelerate agentic testing and bring powerful testing agents into the enterprise, we’ve created UiPath Test Cloud.: From performance testing to functional testing—Test Cloud brings it all together. It comes with open, flexible, and responsible AI across every phase of testing—from test design and test automation to test execution and test management—and all that across your software applications, platforms, and ecosystems—like SAP®, ServiceNow, or Salesforce.\nTest Cloud delivers:\nTest design\n: harness AI to quality-check requirements and generate manual test cases with detailed step-by-step instructions. With context grounding (RAG), Test Cloud ensures AI-generated test cases are relevant and accurate.\nTest automation\n: automate test cases the way you want—whether it's low-code or coded UI or API automation, across any of your enterprise ecosystems.\nTest execution\n: leverage self-healing, distributed, and cloud-based test execution and plug your testing into your ecosystem with CI/CD integrations to keep pace with fast-paced agile software development teams.\nTest management\n: Test Cloud offers rich analytics, test data management, and over 50 integrations with application lifecycle management (ALM) tools like Jira, Azure DevOps, and SAP Solution Manager. These capabilities empower you to orchestrate testing across teams and platforms.\nTest Cloud isn’t just built for software testing today; it gets enterprises ready for what’s coming next. On the one hand, it helps you automate the traditional, deterministic, and rule-based testing tasks teams have been doing for years. But Test Cloud also helps you automate and streamline the messier, non-linear and non-deterministic testing challenges that are becoming the new normal. That’s the power of agentic testing.\nUiPath Autopilot: out-of-the-box agentic testing\nUiPath Test Cloud brings agentic testing to life in two ways. The first—with its focus on fast, out-of-the-box agentic testing—is\nUiPath Autopilot\n™, which is fully embedded in Test Cloud.\nAutopilot is like a digital testing companion, designed to support testers from start to finish. It acts as a ready-made testing agent able to handle a vast range of core testing tasks, from generating test cases to analyzing test results.\nHere's how it transforms each phase of the testing lifecycle:\nTest design\nUiPath Autopilot intelligently analyzes requirements—whether they’re user stories, SAP transactions, or even documents like BPMN diagrams—and generates high-quality manual test cases, complete with step-by-step instructions and expected outcomes. You can fine-tune the results with optional prompts—for example, ‘focus on usability scenarios’ or ‘include invalid input cases’—for precision and coverage.\nTest automation\nTurn those manual test cases into working automated scripts. Autopilot reads the steps, taps into your object repository, and generates either coded or low-code automations. It can even fix validation errors, generate synthetic test data, and perform fuzzy verifications—streamlining a process that used to take hours into minutes.\nTest management\nOnce test cases are running, Autopilot turns raw logs into insights. It analyzes execution results to surface common failure patterns (e.g., performance errors), links them back to their root causes, and recommends fixes—all through a dynamic, interactive reporting interface. Plus, you can search your entire test project the way you think, in plain English.\nAll of these out-of-the-box AI agents provided by Autopilot are made secure within the\nUiPath AI Trust Layer\n, ensuring open, flexible, and responsible AI that’s easy to track and respects your enterprise data policies.\nYou can see how UiPath Autopilot augments testers and accelerates the entire testing lifecycle in the demo below:\nUiPath Agent Builder: Custom testing agents, built your way\nThese out-of-the-box AI agents provide a great starting point—but they're not nearly enough to cover the full range of challenges you're facing in software testing. For teams with unique testing challenges, UiPath provides\nUiPath Agent Builder\n, enabling you to create custom AI agents that are tailored to your specific testing needs.\nWatch the Agent Builder Dev Dive\n.\nTesting agent development from scratch\nAgent Builder lets you choose the foundational large language model (LLM) your agent will run on, whether it’s from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or your own custom model. Testers can then build out the rest of their testing agent with natural language prompts and tool selection. They can define the agent’s goals, responsibilities, and behavior just by using plain English. Finally, testers can connect their agent to the necessary tools like prebuilt activities, existing UI or API automations, or even other agents.\nTest, tune, and trust your testing agents Crucially, Agent Builder isn’t just a development environment for agents, it’s also a place where you can test them. Agent Builder provides built-in evaluation tools that let you test agents before deployment. Testers define scenarios, run test cases, and get an overall health score that helps them evaluate agent performance. They will even receive suggestions on how to improve their prompts or agent designs, ensuring agents are both effective and reliable.\nGet the checklist\n: 10 steps for getting started with Agent Builder for agentic testing\nDeploy and share via UiPath Autopilot\nOnce built, custom testing agents can be accessed through UiPath Autopilot in our\nAssistant\n, making them easily accessible to your entire testing team. Custom agents will appear in natural language conversations, suggested when their skill set matches a challenge a tester is facing. It’s like having an experienced coworker jump in at the right moment to keep the testing lifecycle rolling.\nTo see how easy it is to build custom agents in Agent Builder, watch this demo where we create a ‘data retriever’ agent helping testers find test data in their software applications:\nCustom testing agents built with Agent Builder are powerful productivity force multipliers. However, custom agents are typically narrowly focused in their function and so have a bounded value. It’s the combined use of multiple custom agents, in conjunction with generalist testing assistants like Autopilot, which accelerates and simplifies testing.\nHere’s a sneak peek at what’s coming next...discover how our built-in AI agents and your custom AI agents will soon team up to become your digital testing buddy:\nI've also written about agentic testing on the UiPath Community blog.\nRead \"Agentic testing: augmenting testers with AI agents for greater productivity.\"\nThe future of testing is agentic\nAgentic testing isn’t a future state, it’s happening right now. By combining out-of-the-box AI agents via Autopilot with the flexibility to build your own agents with Agent Builder, UiPath Test Cloud delivers all the capabilities you need to start agentic testing today. We empower testers and engineers to work smarter, move faster, and focus on what truly matters: delivering high quality software at high speed, with confidence.\nAnd all this isn't just a concept or an idea, agentic testing is real—it's delivering real value to real customers today. Take Cisco, for example—they've been able to cut their testing efforts almost in half with our agentic testing capabilities. And if it's making such a real difference for Cisco, just imagine what agentic testing with Test Cloud could do for you.\nIf you want to explore more:\nWatch our agentic testing webinar\nTry UiPath Test Cloud today\nTopics:\nTechnical Tuesday\nAgent Builder\nAgentic\nAutopilot\nIngo\nPhilipp\nSenior Director, Product Management\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nProduct and Updates\nSeptember 9, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: Bridging traditional automation and agentic autonomy\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 12, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: How UiPath Maestro and REFramework work better together\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 5, 2025\nGoodbye workarounds: UiPath delivers native automation for macOS\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSubscribe\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSign up today and we'll email you the newest articles every week.\nThank you for subscribing!\nThank you for subscribing!

It’s designed to build bridges—not walls—across all of your systems, and created to power truly agentic and autonomous workflows of tomorrow. And it puts at the center perhaps the most important challenge in bringing agentic AI to enterprise workflows: balancing autonomy with control.\nFirst introduced in 2019, our market-leading business automation platform has helped thousands of customers discover, manage, and operate deterministic task automations at scale. Now it is evolving further. Our platform continues to shape the future of work as we evolve into an increasingly sophisticated AI-native platform, where agentic AI combines with robotic process automation (RPA) to not only help our customers automate workflows, but also to orchestrate and transform end-to-end business processes.\nThe strategic pillars of agentic automation\nThe new platform is built around the four strategic pillars of agentic automation:\nEnterprise agents:\nwe are introducing AI agents that complement and work with our robots to optimize workflows and processes to achieve the business’ desired business outcomes. We offer UiPath Agent Builder, an enterprise capability for building custom AI agents using a low-code developer experience.\nAgentic orchestration:\nwe are evolving our orchestration to the process level, offering optimization, and intelligence capabilities that span entire workflows.\nBest-in-class automation:\nwe are constantly infusing our core automation products with new AI capabilities, including intelligent document processing (IDP), intelligent Extraction Processing (IXP), and process mining.\nTrusted cloud:\nOur entire platform is built on our AI Trust Layer that provides audit, governance, and context grounding—and extends to dedicated, isolated options to meet certain geographic and industry-specific requirements.\nSo here it is: a new platform that intertwines through the operations of all agents, people, and robots, effectively creating the first unified system to orchestrate complex, dynamic, and reliable autonomous operations.\nThe new platform emphasizes the transition from deterministic automation to agentic orchestration, enabling intelligent collaboration and decision making across structured and unstructured workflows.\nThe platform is fully compatible with existing robots that execute millions of automations worldwide today. It provides a seamless transition to agentic AI for the millions of developers in the UiPath Community. And it opens up entirely new business opportunities for thousands of partners.\nKey elements of the UiPath Platform for agentic automation\nLet’s walk through the new platform. It’s built on layers of technologies and market-leading capabilities, many of which are familiar to our customers today, such as our IDP.\nSecurity and governance as a foundation:\nA\nunified, secure foundation layer\nprovides auditing, compliance, and governance, as well as secure integration services and easy-to-use development tools across our platform.\nThree core functional layers:\nAn\nActivities Layer\noffers a suite of activities (or tools) that provides unique capabilities to automate all tasks and processes. Activities can include processing of complex documents, as well as building robots, AI agents, and forms.\nA\nWorkflows Layer\nallows for the complete assembly of agentic workflows. These are adaptive workflows that adjust based on real-time data and contextual understanding, driven by agentic decision making. They also facilitate human-in-the-loop exception management and agent testing for enhanced validation of autonomous automations.\nA\nProcesses Layer\nfacilitates the coordination of agents, people, and robots, enabling real-time decision making and reliable task execution across complex workflows. Processes can be visualized, monitored, and improved end to end.\nOver time, we will be introducing specialized agents that sit on top of these layers, combining all of their capabilities, to drive industry-specific autonomous solutions. Our recent acquisition of Peak, an AI-native company that offers specialized agentic solutions for optimizing product inventory and pricing, moves us closer to this goal.\nIntelligent actor collaboration:\nAgentic automation requires the coordinated efforts of three core entities: AI agents, people, and robots. Each one plays a critical role in agentic processes.\nAgents:\nautonomous AI systems with contextual awareness and decision-making capabilities, capable of acting independently and proactively in unstructured environments\nRobots:\ndeterministic software robots that emulate human actions for structured, rules-based tasks\nPeople:\nstrategic collaborators, involved in decision making through human-in-the-loop processes, ensuring ethical oversight and contextual judgment\nConversational AI tools to speed time to value:\nUiPath Autopilot™—our conversational AI assistant utilizing GenAI and natural language processing (NLP)—speeds every interaction around the UiPath Platform, including development, testing, and even business user interactions.\nSee Autopilot in action\n.\nA game-changer: bringing the fully automated enterprise to life\nUnlike most agentic AI players today, we are committed to building bridges—not walls—between systems. We have the broadest and most diverse ecosystem with predefined connectivity. Integrations with leading enterprise systems and cloud platforms today including AWS, Google Cloud, LangChain, Microsoft, SAP®, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack, and more, showcase our comprehensive connectivity across digital ecosystems.\nIn short, our new platform is a game-changer for automation by unifying deterministic automation and agentic AI. It gives enterprises all of the tools and advanced capabilities they require to quickly scale automation across structured and unstructured processes.\nWe have always aspired to enable the fully automated enterprise, where automation ran through the warp and weft of every operation and activity releasing enormous new value. With this new platform, we are there!\nJoin us at the virtual Agentic AI Summit\non March 25 to see agentic AI and automation in action.\nTopics:\nAgentic\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nFuture Of Automation\nCommunity\nAgent Builder\nIntelligent document processing\nAgentic orchestration\nBobby\nPatrick\n(Previously) Chief Marketing Officer\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nProduct and Updates\nSeptember 9, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: Bridging traditional automation and agentic autonomy\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 12, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: How UiPath Maestro and REFramework work better together\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 5, 2025\nGoodbye workarounds: UiPath delivers native automation for macOS\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSubscribe\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSign up today and we'll email you the newest articles every week.\nThank you for subscribing!\nThank you for subscribing!

So why are your teams still stuck in manual workflows? One big reason: too many disconnected tools slowing everything down.\nTool sprawl causes serious friction. It drags out automation delivery, delays business value, and drives up costs with redundant and clunky systems. It also adds technical debt—making it harder to scale automation with the governance and consistency you need.\nFor chief information officers (CIOs) and digital leaders, this post unpacks how agentic automation—and a\nnew unified developer experience in\nUiPath Studio Web\n—can help you reduce tool sprawl and unlock real results.\nNew here?\nAgentic automation is an advanced strategy in intelligent enterprise automation that integrates traditional RPA, artificial intelligence, and human decision-making capabilities, fostering an ecosystem where people, robots, and AI agents work synergistically to optimize operational processes, driving efficiency and productivity. Not familiar with agentic automation?\nStart here\n.\nTool sprawl isn’t just frustrating—it’s a blocker to next-gen automation\nFragmentation happens when different teams adopt separate tools for similar jobs. Each one solves part of the puzzle, but nothing fits together cleanly. Fragmentation:\nSlows things down\nIncreases costs\nMakes governance difficult\nBut as automation gets smarter—moving from task automation to AI-driven agents—those problems don’t just persist. They get bigger.\nAgentic automation adds new layers of complexity. More integration points. Tighter collaboration between business and tech, and a greater need for governance.\nDisconnected tools can’t keep up. You can’t scale agentic automation on a fragmented foundation. Start by unifying the development experience.\nThat’s exactly what the unified developer experience in UiPath Studio Web is built for.\nIntroducing the unified developer experience\nAvailable within Studio Web, the new unified developer experience streamlines the entire automation lifecycle—so your teams can adopt and scale agentic automation faster, with less friction and a lot more impact.\nWhether building a simple RPA workflow or sophisticated AI agent-driven solutions, your teams have one browser-based environment to:\nDesign, build, test, and deploy automations with consistency and speed\nBring RPA, APIs, and AI agents together—no context switching required\nCollaborate seamlessly across developers, business users, and IT\nStay in control with guardrails that flex to fit every role\nA strategic advantage for digital leaders\nFor CIOs, chief operating officers (COOs), and digital leaders, a unified developer experience isn’t just a nice-to-have—it’s a game changer. It’s how you deliver automation faster, see business value sooner, and cut costs along the way.\nInstead of juggling disconnected tools, you get one streamlined environment. That means less technical debt, fewer headaches from tool sprawl, and a lot more agility. And governance and security baked in.\nBest of all, it helps your business and automation teams work better together, so you get smoother collaboration and happier employees.\nThis isn’t just about making development easier. It’s about helping your teams make a bigger impact with less effort.\nWhat this means for your business\nAdding tools won’t help if they don’t work together. Fragmentation isn’t just inconvenient—it’s a barrier to scale, innovation, and automation that actually delivers.\nAgentic automation changes what's possible. But only if you support it with the right foundation.\nWith Studio Web, you can break free from fragmented tooling and unlock automation that’s smart, scalable, and enterprise ready.\nWhat's next? If you're already a UiPath customer, your developers can\ntry out the unified developer experience for themselves within UiPath Studio Web\n.\nNew to UiPath?\nExplore how others in your industry and role are using agentic automation\n.\nTopics:\nStudio\nStudio Web\nSophia\nZhylych\nProduct Marketing Manager\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nProduct and Updates\nSeptember 9, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: Bridging traditional automation and agentic autonomy\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 12, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: How UiPath Maestro and REFramework work better together\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 5, 2025\nGoodbye workarounds: UiPath delivers native automation for macOS\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSubscribe\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSign up today and we'll email you the newest articles every week.\nThank you for subscribing!\nThank you for subscribing!

Everyone’s talking about it, building it, testing it—and we’re right there in the thick of it, bringing real-world agentic automation to life.\nAt the UiPath booth, the energy was high. People didn’t just want to hear about AI agents reasoning and chatting. They wanted to see what it looks like\nwhen AI agents, robots, and people actually work together\nto move a business process forward.\nAnd we delivered.\nAI that doesn’t just think—it gets things done\nLet’s take loan origination as an example. It’s a messy, multi-step process. It involves scanning documents, pulling data from various systems, checking eligibility, talking to customers—the kind of work that’s ripe for automation, but too complex for any one AI agent to handle solo.\nThat’s where agentic automation comes in. Picture this:\nA UiPath Agent kicks things off, using robots to grab data and tools like\nUiPath IXP\n(Intelligent Xtraction and Processing) to understand scanned IDs, bank statements, or PDF forms.\nIt checks basic eligibility criteria and performs initial data entry.\nBut when it is time to write a customer-friendly message or apply nuanced judgment, it’s a person’s turn—assisted by Microsoft 365 Copilot for content generation or Salesforce Agentforce, which has richer customer context.\nEach agent does what it’s best at. That’s\nagentic automation\nin action.\nSeamless handoffs with bidirectional integrations\nFor seamless handoffs between agents, you need bi-directional connectivity. At Microsoft Build, we were especially proud to show the\nbi-directional integration between UiPath Agents and Microsoft Copilot Studio\nin action. In plain terms: we’ve made it easier than ever for Microsoft and UiPath agents to talk to each other, hand off tasks, and collaborate across platforms.\nUiPath Agents\nthat specialize in working across multiple systems and understanding semi-structured documents can now trigger\nCopilot Studio agents\nor\nPower Automate flows\nwhich reason over data in Microsoft Graph or Dataverse, generate content in Microsoft 365 apps, or take action that needs multiple Dynamics objects as context.\nCopilot Studio agents\ncan also call on\nUiPath agents or automations\nfor downstream execution—think “Process this claim” or “Check if this part exists in any of my ERPs.” This integration brings together two powerful agentic capabilities to enable customers to automate end-to-end processes.\nAnd behind it all is\nUiPath Maestro\n™, a unified process orchestration layer, helping you manage your processes across AI agents, robots, and people with a single pane of glass. This cross-platform orchestration unlocks new levels of productivity and contextual decision making across the Microsoft and UiPath ecosystems.\nReal results: 500% ROI and thousands of hours saved\nTake Johnson Controls, for example. They started with automation built in UiPath and Microsoft Power Automate. After plugging in agentic capabilities using our new integration, they saw a 500% additional return on investment and gave 18,000 hours back to the business each year.\nThat’s not a proof of concept. That’s real business value—delivered at scale.\nRead the full story\n.\nControlled agency: the right work, done by the right worker\nHere’s something we’ve learned: adaptability comes at the cost of occasional errors. You can unleash the full potential of an LLM when someone is constantly supervising an AI assistant. But for real agency, you need to trust an AI agent to “do its thing” with accuracy and reliability.  .\nThat’s why agentic automation needs  controlled agency. It means deploying agents with the evaluations, tools, and escalation guardrails for complex tasks. But  AI agents hand off deterministic and repetitive tasks to a robot to execute those tasks with precision. And when judgment or empathy is needed, they call in a person.\nDo not rely on an agent to do anything you can do deterministically, because agents will make mistakes\nMarco Casaliana, VP, Azure AI\nTake computer use agents (CUAs). They are getting good at emulating people on a computer—a powerful capability that will shape the future of automation. But they’re still slow, pricey, and somewhat error-prone. So we created the\nUiPath UI agent\n, which blends CUAs like OpenAI’s Operator, Anthropic CCU, or Google’s Gemini with reliable, fast RPA. The result? Enterprise-grade agents that run unattended reliably—and don’t fumble the keyboard.\nSee controlled agency in action\n.\nBuilt to be open—and stay that way\nUiPath is committed to building an open ecosystem across foundational models, industry-leading tools, plugins, and AI agents, enabling agent interoperability with both proprietary and open-source technology stacks.\nUse OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or any of the hundreds of models hosted on your own  instance of a platform like\nFireworks AI\nWork with\nLangChain\n, Crew AI, Microsoft Copilot Studio, or Salesforce Agentforce agents, plus support for emerging protocols like MCP and A2A\nPick the best tool for the job—reasoning, summarization, and extraction with our massive\nconnector library\nto get the work done\nNo black boxes. No hard dependencies. Just the freedom to build what works for your business.\nLet’s make AI operational—together\nIf Microsoft Build 2025 showed us anything, it’s that people are ready to go beyond the hype and start building real, usable AI systems. Systems that do actual work. Systems that understand context. Systems that play well with others.\nThat’s what UiPath is here to do.

You’re leaving value on the table.\nStill running AI agents and RPA in silos in financial services? You’re leaving value on the table.\nby\nCharlie\nFitzpatrick\n•\nMay 21, 2025\nShare at:\nAI agents are undeniably gaining traction across financial services. From underwriting to fraud detection, teams are racing to launch pilots, test new use cases, and explore how AI agents can transform their part of the business. But in many cases, these efforts are unfolding in silos—disconnected from broader automation initiatives, existing tech infrastructure, and sometimes even from the teams that have been leading enterprise transformation for years.\nThat fragmentation is starting to show. Budgets are being duplicated. Capabilities are rebuilt from scratch when they already exist elsewhere in the organization. And without a clear governance model or shared KPIs, it’s getting harder to measure what’s‌ delivering value—and what’s just noise.\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. Financial services institutions that are best positioned to scale and monetize agentic AI aren’t starting over—they’re converging. Specifically, they’re aligning investments with the well-established automation programs they’ve already built over the past decade. That includes RPA, workflow automation, and broader transformation teams who know how to scale technology with discipline, governance, and results.\nThe best-performing organizations in this space are ones that combine these capabilities into a single operating model, eliminating duplication, combining intake and value realization, and driving sustainable growth and competitive advantage through disciplined governance and continuous optimization.\nRPA isn’t going anywhere—but agentic AI is making it smarter\nAI agents aren’t here to replace RPA. AI agents are improving automation through 'agentic automation' by giving it more contextual awareness and decision making capabilities. RPA remains a highly controllable, structured, and enterprise-hardened way to get things done. What agentic AI adds is intelligence: the ability to interpret unstructured inputs, make real-time decisions, and adapt to nuance. But AI without a delivery mechanism often stalls. The reverse is also true—RPA without intelligence can hit limits in complex environments and prevent workflows from being automated end-to-end.\nTogether, agentic AI and RPA deliver more complete, resilient, and measurable outcomes.\nDon’t scrap the existing delivery structures—build on them\nMany financial institutions already have the building blocks to do this well. RPA centers of excellence (CoEs), for example, have laid strong foundations for structure, scalability, and ROI. With clear governance, reusable frameworks, and funding models already in place, these teams don’t need to be rebuilt—they can evolve.\nBringing agentic AI into these operating models doesn’t mean slowing down innovation. It means channeling it into a model that already knows how to move from pilot to production. It means building a shared vision, a shared roadmap, and a shared understanding of what value looks like across teams.\nIt also means giving existing automation teams new room to grow. Many experienced RPA developers and business analysts are already looking for their next evolution—and agentic automation provides a natural path forward. With their deep knowledge of workflows, systems, and enterprise constraints, these professionals are well positioned to lead the charge into agent design, prompt engineering, and human-in-the-loop orchestration. Rather than starting over, organizations can invest in expanding skill sets and responsibilities—creating momentum, not friction.\nThe next wave of transformation won’t come from the tech alone\nTo succeed, financial institutions must treat every investment—whether in agentic AI or automation—as a business value initiative. That means prioritizing ‌capabilities that can‌ scale, that serve real business goals, and that can be tracked with measurable outcomes. Sometimes, that will involve complex AI models. Other times, the right answer might be a simple automation built with tools you already have. What matters most is the result—not the complexity.\nAs expectations rise and the pace of innovation accelerates, the winners will have aligned their tools, teams, and strategies to drive real, measurable impact—at scale.\nCustomer example: Fiserv\nAn early automation adopter, learn how Fiserv is driving tremendous value from RPA while combining it with enterprise-wide AI adoption.\nFor Fiserv, UiPath Robots extract merchant details from the database, cross check them via a Bing API, and select the correct MCC codes using generative AI prompts from UiPath GenAI Activities. Validation rules handle 98% of cases, with outliers sent to UiPath Action Center for review. UiPath Autopilot™ troubleshoots MCC automation workflows by identifying errors and optimizing performance. Fiserv also is exploring Autopilot to streamline contract processes for its service level agreement team.\nLearn more about Fiserv’s automation journey\n.\nHow do financial services firms make the best use of these technologies?\nTo fully unlock the value of your AI and RPA investments, you must bridge the gap between the two and create a unified strategy that aligns innovation with business outcomes. Combining AI’s decision making capabilities with RPA’s executional strength leads to a more cohesive, scalable solution that drives measurable results—whether through direct business value, such as cost reduction and revenue generation, or indirect value like enhanced customer service and regulatory compliance.\nFinancial services institutions that strategically combine these technologies are not just staying competitive—they are building a self-sustaining cycle of growth and innovation.\nReady to explore how to bring AI and RPA together in your organization?

Unlike traditional automation, these intelligent agents can adapt to unfamiliar situations, reshaping how companies streamline operations, enhance decision making, and improve customer experiences. With 78% of companies planning to implement AI agents into production soon, integrating these advanced systems into critical workflows is becoming essential for maintaining competitiveness.\nUiPath offers a world-class low-code platform that democratizes automation development. This approach empowers a broader range of individuals to build agents without requiring expertise as data scientists or professional developers. For advanced developers and ML teams seeking deeper customization and control, LangChain's powerful\nLangGraph\nframework allows developers to build context-aware agents that balance control with agency. Additionally, LangChain's offerings—like\nLangSmith\nand LangGraph Platform—provide robust capabilities for deploying, monitoring, evaluating, and debugging agents.\nToday, we’re excited to announce:\nNative support for LangSmith observability in the UiPath LLM Gateway via OpenTelemetry\n(OTLP), enabling developers to monitor, debug, and evaluate LLM-powered features in UiPath using LangSmith either in LangChain’s cloud or self-hosted on-premises. This feature is currently in private preview.\nA collaboration between UiPath and LangChain centered on the Agent Protocol\n. Our teams are actively working on seamless interoperability between UiPath and external systems like LangGraph Platform that support the\nAgent Protocol\n.\nFor UiPath customers seeking to incorporate LangGraph agents into their agentic automations,\nwe are enabling deployment of LangGraph agents in UiPath infrastructure\n.\nThis partnership has two big benefits for UiPath developers:\nFirst\n, the LangSmith integration will give UiPath developers a world-class observability capability to ship agents with confidence. Observability for agentic applications differs from traditional software applications, and a major challenge when building agents is understanding and trusting their behavior as they become more complex. By integrating with LangSmith, the industry leader in AI observability, we aim to help UiPath developers deploy with confidence.\nSecond\n, the LangGraph integration (through Agent Protocol or deployment) will enable UiPath developers to integrate LangGraph-powered agents into their automations, combining robust UiPath Robots, low-code agents, and human-in-the-loop features with LangGraph's agents. For example, a clinical research process built in UiPath Maestro™ can be augmented with an advanced Open Deep Research agent built with LangGraph.\nHarrison Chase, CEO of LangChain\n, highlights the importance of this collaboration for the ecosystem:\nWe want to enable developers of all types to build agents. We’ve seen a key part of this be AI observability, and we’re excited to integrate LangSmith with UiPath to help even more builders ship agents with confidence. Additionally, our collaboration with UiPath on the Agent Protocol ensures that LangGraph agents can seamlessly participate in UiPath automations, broadening their reach and enabling developers to build more cohesive, cross-platform workflows.\nRaghu Malpani, Chief Technology Officer at UiPath\n, emphasizes the significance of these announcements for the UiPath developer community:\nOur collaboration with LangChain on LangSmith and Agent Protocol advances interoperability across agent frameworks. Further, by enabling the deployment of LangGraph agents into UiPath's enterprise-grade infrastructure, we are expanding the capabilities of our platform and opening up more possibilities for our developer community.\nUiPath developers looking to incorporate LangGraph agents into their agentic automations can start building and testing these agents now using familiar Python tooling, including tools like LangSmith. They can then connect to these agents deployed on\nLangChain’s infrastructure\n, or\nrefer to the UiPath LangChain SDK documentation\nto deploy on UiPath infrastructure.\nNext steps\nExperience the benefits of integrating LangGraph agents into UiPath today:\nSign up for UiPath\nUiPath Python and LangChain SDK\nTopics:\nAgentic\nTaqi\nJaffri\nSenior Director, Product Management\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nProduct and Updates\nSeptember 9, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: Bridging traditional automation and agentic autonomy\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 12, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: How UiPath Maestro and REFramework work better together\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 5, 2025\nGoodbye workarounds: UiPath delivers native automation for macOS\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSubscribe\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSign up today and we'll email you the newest articles every week.\nThank you for subscribing!\nThank you for subscribing!

But this question misses the mark. Agentic AI won’t replace automation, it will make it even more valuable.\nUiPath has always been ahead of the curve. Our early adoption of AI technologies like computer vision and document understanding proved that automation could be more than a set of rigid rules. It could see, think, and even reason. That same mindset drives our current vision around agentic automation: combining AI agents, robots, and people to enable long-running, adaptive workflows with real-time decisioning.\nA spectrum of control, risk, and agency\nIn every AI capability, a trade-off has always been made between agency and reliability. Agentic AI is no different and, due to its underlying model architecture, high agency is usually prioritized. This makes AI agents ideal for tasks with lots of uncertainty and the requirement to change and adapt on the fly. However, businesses need different levels of control for all kinds of different tasks.\nThis need for granularity and customization informs our own approach to agentic UI automation:\nAgentic UI automation is a category of agentic automation that focuses on using agentic AI to perform UI-based tasks. The UiPath Platform™ provides access to agentic UI automation through different layers, giving you the flexibility to choose a solution that addresses your business need with the right balance of agency and risk:\nAt the\nselector level\n: UiPath semantic selectors help robots better identify UI elements as part of your automation. This happens at the micro-task level but covers scenarios where traditional selectors fall short, allowing you to benefit from agentic AI with minimal risk and maximum predictability.\nAt the\nweb form level\n: Similar to semantic selectors, UiPath semantic activities use agentic AI to work with UI elements at the micro-task level. However, they handle more complex and dynamic scenarios and are specifically designed for working with web forms. Semantic activities bring greater resiliency and adaptability to your automations while deploying agentic AI with limited, controlled autonomy.\nAt the\nsingle-app context level\n: UiPath ScreenPlay leverages large action models (LAMs) to turn your instructions into real, on-screen actions. Unlike the micro-task solutions mentioned above, ScreenPlay operates across an entire application with greater agency and can perform tasks previously out of reach for traditional automation.\nAt the\nmulti-app context level\n: the final layer of our agentic UI offering will be an attended desktop agent (currently in development). It acts as a digital assistant and can autonomously execute tasks across multiple apps and systems.\nDOM extraction: the core engine behind our agentic offering\nBefore diving into the details of each of the layers of our agentic offering, let's talk about  the AI-powered document object model (DOM) extraction engine that sits at the heart of all our agentic UI automation capabilities.\nMost of the recent work on computer use is focused on using screenshots to observe the target application’s state and content. While it’s a fair approach that tries to stay as close as possible to the human way of observing the environment (including screens), it can lack a few key advantages typical to extracting a curated DOM:\nThe ability to see an entire scrollable webpage—rather than its current viewport only—combined with slow, frustrating scrolling actions. DOM-based approaches provide not only more reliable and accurate data extraction, but also faster processing speed. In the DOM-based approach, all the content is extracted once at run-time.\nThe ability to use hidden, useful data on on-screen UI elements, such as a hidden text label that describes an icon.\nThat's why we’ve heavily invested in building our own custom AI-powered DOM extraction engine. It powers semantic selectors, semantic activities, ScreenPlay, as well as our Clipboard AI capability (\nrecognized as one of TIME's Best Inventions of 2023\n). The Clipboard AI capability is available as part of UiPath Autopilot.\nThe best part about DOM extraction is that it works in conjunction with image-based understanding (using AI Computer Vision internally and another dedicated AI model for building the target-anchor pairs), so it doesn’t miss out on relevant screen understanding clues that pure-DOM extractors might miss.\nMicro agents: where the agentic story begins\nAgentic automation doesn’t have to be all-or-nothing. As mentioned earlier, different business needs call for different levels of agentic solutions. And sometimes that means leveraging agentic AI for small micro-level tasks. That's why we introduced the concept of micro agents as the intelligent stepping stones between the more traditional automation activities and full-blown autonomous agents.\nSemantic selectors and semantic activities (like Fill Form, Extract Form Data and Update UI Element, formerly known as Set Value) can be defined as micro agents. They are designed for specific, high-precision tasks and enable you to benefit from:\nTask-specific intelligence\nPrecise semantic matching, powered by generative AI\nPredictable execution, enabled by layered fallback strategies\nThey are not micro agents in name only. These tools exhibit constrained autonomy: reliable, bounded, and robust. Rather than limiting agentic potential, micro agents enable it, laying the groundwork for higher levels of autonomy while ensuring enterprise-grade stability.\nLet's take a closer look at how semantic selectors and semantic activities bring the vision of micro agents to life.\nSemantic selectors: targeting made resilient\nBuilt on top of our custom DOM extraction engine and AI reasoning engines like GPT, semantic selectors elevate how automation identifies UI elements. Traditional selectors, while fast, are fragile. Semantic selectors overcome this by allowing developers (or an AI assistant like\nUiPath Autopilot\n™) to describe UI targets in plain language:\n\"the button that submits the form\"\n.\nAt runtime, the system intelligently determines which fallback layer to use: strict and fuzzy selectors first, then semantic selectors, and then computer vision. This best-of-both-worlds strategy delivers both low-latency execution and high resilience.\nSemantic activities: intelligent form-focused data extraction and input\nSemantic activities\nare specifically designed for working with forms, offering a direct and powerful method for data extraction and data input. They use semantic matching, semantic execution, and DOM extractor-based interactions to handle dynamic scenarios where screen elements might change and otherwise break execution. They can very easily be used to transfer data between webforms of various kinds, greatly simplifying any form-filling or form extraction scenario.\nFrom micro to macro scale: UiPath ScreenPlay\nWe've applied the same principles behind semantic selectors and semantic activities to\nUiPath ScreenPlay\n. ScreenPlay is an agent that brings intelligent automation directly to the user's desktop. Unlike task-specific micro agents, ScreenPlay operates across an entire application. It understands natural language goals, like \"find the invoice from last month and download it” and autonomously navigates interfaces the way humans do to execute the needed actions. It can also handle input/output and monitor UI state.\nFor now, ScreenPlay is scoped to a single app or URL, ensuring high reliability. But it opens the door to broader agentic execution patterns without sacrificing predictability. ScreenPlay is all about\nunlocking the true potential of large action models\n(LAMs).\nAttended desktop agent: a true computer use capability\nAnd we’re not stopping there. Our team is hard at work creating a next-gen attended desktop agent that will operate as an autonomous digital assistant across multiple applications on your machine. Think of it as an entity capable of understanding your workspace context and acting accordingly in an attended environment.\nOur vision for the desktop agent isn't about discarding what made traditional automation great. It's about enhancing it with layers of intelligence that make automation more flexible, resilient, and ultimately more helpful. Stay tuned for more updates about the desktop agent.\nAutomation just got a lot smarter\nTo sum up, agentic UI automation isn’t a replacement for traditional automation, it’s an evolution. From the early days of computer vision to today’s layered agentic automation stack, we’ve consistently delivered pragmatic, resilient, and intelligent automation.\nIf automation was about getting repetitive tasks done, agentic UI automation is focused on handling tasks that aren’t solvable by repetitive actions, those requiring a high degree of adaptability, autonomy, intelligence, and dependence on variable input factors. And that journey starts with trust, predictability, and a gradual path toward agency; all things that we've built into the DNA of the UiPath Platform.\nYou don’t need to throw the most powerful tool at every problem; some are simple enough to solve with more cost-effective methods. Instead, you want to optimize what you’re using for every situation. Therefore, you need the flexibility of a platform that can cover all use cases. You might need low risk and high reliability for critical, repetitive processes, while still introducing intelligence and autonomy where it adds value to your outcomes. It’s a philosophy that echoes the grocery store\nREMA 1000's marketing principle\n: \"simplicity is king.\"\nWith micro agents like semantic activities and semantic selectors at the base, ScreenPlay as the next evolution you can use today, and our upcoming attended desktop agent, the UiPath agentic stack empowers you to scale automation confidently and intelligently.\nWant to get started?\nJoin the UiPath Insider program\nto try out ScreenPlay and get early access to new features and products.\nTopics:\nAgentic\nTechnical Tuesday\nBogdan\nSultana\nSenior Product Manager\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 12, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: How UiPath Maestro and REFramework work better together\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 5, 2025\nGoodbye workarounds: UiPath delivers native automation for macOS\nProduct and Updates\nJuly 29, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: Should you process your enterprise documents with LLMs?\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSubscribe\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSign up today and we'll email you the newest articles every week.\nThank you for subscribing!\nThank you for subscribing!

If you've been following the tech space lately, you've likely heard the buzz about large action models (LAMs) and how they're supposedly going to change everything about how we automate work. Companies like Anthropic with\nComputerUse\nand OpenAI with\nOperator\nare making headlines with their ability to control computers using natural language instructions.\nAnd honestly? The hype isn't entirely misplaced. This technology is genuinely impressive.\nBut there's a gap between the public perception and reality that needs addressing. Today, we're pulling back the curtain on\nUI agents\n–what they are, what they can (and can't) do, and why the UiPath approach might be the only practical way to harness their power in enterprise environments right now.\nWhat are UI agents?\nUI agents are powered by LAMs, AI systems trained to use computers the way humans do, with a mouse and keyboard. What makes them revolutionary is that instead of relying on hardcoded steps and traditional selectors like traditional RPA, they operate based on goals and natural language instructions.\nInstead of programming each specific step to navigate to a folder, scroll down, click on a file, and so on, you can simply specify \"Find the invoice from last month and download it\" as the goal.\nThese agents can \"see\" the screen, understand context, and adapt to changes in interfaces that would break traditional automations. They bring a whole new level of flexibility and intelligence to automation that wasn't possible before.\nThe promise: better, faster, easier, more\nThe potential upside of this technology is enormous:\nMore resilient automations:\nwhen UIs get updated or elements move around dynamically, UI agents can adapt without breaking.\nLower development barrier:\ncreating automations becomes significantly easier, requiring less technical expertise.\nEnables previously unfeasible tasks:\nautomate the same basic operations across systems with varying interfaces–like entering identical data into hundreds of different websites–that would require custom development for each site with traditional\nRPA\n.\nNew cognitive capabilities:\nagents can make in-context decisions, navigate websites based on semantic criteria, extract insights from multiple sources, or simply operate interfaces without ever seeing them before.\nCross-platform compatibility:\nworks across operating systems, increasing the automation coverage of your company.\nAll of this adds up to lower total cost of ownership for automations and opens the door to scenarios that were previously unfeasible or prohibitively expensive to automate.\nThe reality check\nThe promise is real, but so are the limitations. As exciting as this technology is, the current generation of LAMs faces several challenges:\nThey can be\nslow\ncompared to traditional RPA\nThey're\nexpensive\nto run\nThey can be\nunpredictable\non longer, complex scenarios\nIt's worth noting that all current models on the market are essentially first-generation (V1) implementations. There are no V2 models out there yet. The technology is still in its early stages, and even when successful, these models have relatively low reliability on longer scenarios. If you run the same prompt multiple times, they won't succeed 100% of the time, and they won't run consistently.\nThat said, the pace of improvement is remarkable. What seems challenging today may be routine in six months, these models are evolving rapidly. But for now, they're comparable to skilled assistants with unique strengths and clear limitations. Impressive but not yet ready to run your entire business unsupervised.\nAsking a LAM to \"buy me a plane ticket to New York\" might work occasionally in a demo, but run it a thousand times in production, and you'll see failures that would be unacceptable in an enterprise environment.\nFinding the sweet spot\nSo how do we harness the power of this technology while working around its current limitations?\nThe answer is\nmicrotasks\n.\nAfter extensive testing, we've discovered that LAMs truly shine when handling very short sequences of 1-5 steps. A couple of clicks, a few typing actions. That's where reliability starts to approach enterprise standards.\nExamples of excellent microtasks for UI agents:\nLocating and clicking a specific button that may move position based on dynamic content\nFilling out a form field with contextually appropriate information\nExtracting specific data from a table based on semantic criteria\nThis might seem limiting at first glance, but there's a powerful solution: combining these microtasks with traditional automation capabilities.\nThe UiPath difference: integration is everything\nThis is where UiPath enters the picture. We believe that currently, the only way to use LAMs reliably in production, at scale, and unattended, is through integration with an\nautomation platform\nsuch as ours.\nHere's why our approach works:\n1. Access to leading models in one place\nUiPath provides access to Anthropic's ComputerUse, OpenAI's Operator, as well as our own versions right out of the box. No need to manage multiple licenses or integrations. As new models emerge, we'll continue to incorporate them, ensuring you always have access to the best tools for each job. And since the price and capabilities between them varies wildly—like,\norders of magnitude differences\n—this will come in very handy.\n2. Deep platform integration\nWe've embedded these models into our automation platform, allowing you to:\nString together multiple micro-tasks to create complex, reliable processes\nCombine LAM capabilities with our full suite of RPA tools\nDebug and steer the models for maximum performance\n3. Enterprise-grade capabilities\nSchedule, monitor, audit, and scale your automations with the same robust tools you already trust.\nIntegrated approach\nWhile we believe this integrated approach is currently the only practical way to deploy LAMs in enterprise environments, we expect it will soon become the industry standard. The future of automation isn't about LAMs replacing RPA. It's about intelligently combining these technologies to get the best of both worlds. Just like API automation has been coexisting with\nUI automation\n.\nIn action\nThe power of this approach becomes clear in practical examples:\nImagine an automation that needs to interact with a web application where elements dynamically change position based on content. Traditional RPA might struggle with reliable selectors, requiring complex workarounds and constant maintenance.\nWith UI agents, you can simply instruct: \"Click the 'Download Report' button next to the most recent entry.\" The agent understands the semantic relationship and completes the task regardless of where the button appears on screen.\nWe've even demonstrated the flexibility of UI agents by having them identify and click \"Play\" buttons across similar but entirely different video game interfaces without being specifically programmed for each one. This was impossible with traditional automation approaches.\nNeither image– not selector-based automation would work, since the buttons look different, are in different languages, and selectors are not available.\nThe ability to understand context and adapt to different visual layouts showcases exactly why this technology is so promising when applied appropriately.\nThe future is coming; what can you do today?\nWill LAMs eventually become powerful enough to handle entire complex processes without assistance? Almost certainly. But that future isn't here yet.\nIn the meantime, the UiPath approach lets you start capturing the benefits of this revolutionary technology now, without sacrificing the reliability and scalability your business requires.\nUI agents aren't replacing traditional RPA. They're enhancing it, creating a whole that's greater than the sum of its parts.\nJoin in\nUiPath ScreenPlay (formerly UI Agent) is now available in public preview for all enterprise license users.

To us, this recognition highlights the continued strength of our vision and execution in a rapidly growing market that’s transforming how enterprises unlock value from their documents in the age of AI and agentic automation.\nRead the report\n.\nWhy IDP matters\nEvery process in business runs on documents, messages, or communications. From loan applications, and brokerage statements in banking, medical records in healthcare, to order amendments in manufacturing, or invoices in sales and finance, there isn’t a process or task that doesn’t require a message or a document on the path to completion.\nWhile most organizations have automated extraction from structured documents, the majority of enterprise information is still locked in unstructured and complex documents—contracts, reports, emails, and messages. Extracting and acting on this information has remained a challenge.\nMeet UiPath IXP\nUiPath IXP\n(Intelligent Xtraction & Processing) is our next-generation IDP solution that turns all enterprise documents and communications into insight and action at speed and scale. IXP brings together our existing document understanding and communications mining capabilities with the a new capability for unstructured and complex documents.\nIXP is helping enterprises automate complex document workflows, extract critical data with precision, and accelerate decisions. With IXP, organizations can:\nAutomate the extraction and interpretation of data to accelerate complex processes\nImprove employee and customer experiences with faster responses and personalization\nDeploy best-in-class AI to accomplish more, faster, and with greater control\nAs more enterprises embrace agentic automation, IXP is becoming a gateway to scaling agentic automation across the business.\nIf you want to apply agentic automation to any document-based process, intelligent document processing is the missing piece. UiPath IXP takes the pain out of complex document processing to help our customers gain access their structured and unstructured document data.”\nMark Geene, Senior Vice President of AI Products and Solutions, UiPath\nIn his latest blog post\n, Geene digs deeper into the topic of UiPath IXP, and why AI agents need IDP to understand and process enterprise documents consistently, accurately, and at speed and scale.\nWe’re proud to be recognized as a Leader by Gartner, and even more excited to continue empowering our customers to automate more, work smarter, and innovate faster.

AI agents are being embedded in enterprise processes, executing critical tasks that require critical thinking, adaptability, and action.\nAs interest grows, new AI agent integrated development environments (IDEs) are flooding the market. These promise enterprises the capabilities to quickly and reliably build custom AI agents that are tailored to exact business requirements. However, business leaders need to ask themselves:\nWhat’s unique about these build experiences?\nWhat’s my fastest path to success?\nHow do I know when my agent is ready for production?\nIn this blog, I’ll show why an evaluation-driven development philosophy is crucial for getting AI agents into production.  I’ll also explain some of the principles of agent scoring and how leading enterprises are using this approach to build trusted, enterprise-grade AI agents.\nWhat is agent evaluation?\nSo what exactly is agent evaluation, and how is it different from traditional software development testing?\nWhen it comes to gauging the performance of AI agents, unit and integration testing won’t cut it. Every developer needs a way to objectively measure the output and plan (or trajectory) at both build and runtime. They also need the means to compare the two.\nUnlike traditional methods, agent evaluation is an objective assessment of an agent’s performance based on a baseline set of data. It's a systematic approach to measure how well AI agents perform against defined business objectives or user expectations.\nMulti-attribute scoring is a core step in building confidence towards and enjoying rapid success from deploying agents into real-world production environments. The scoring criteria could be:\nQuality of output:\nthe accuracy of the information the agent provides, its structure, tone and style.\nAppropriate and effective tool use:\nfollowing tool descriptions, business policies, guardrails, and even the tool output itself. For example, measuring the accuracy of data retrieved by a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) service.\nAgent planning and task completion:\ndid the agent execute its plan based on how you wanted it to?\nTraditional Testing\nEvaluation\nFocus\nDoes the system function correctly?\nAgent evaluation focuses on performance, quality, and user experience. It measures how well the agent completed its task and is graded against a ground-truth dataset.\nMethodology\nTesting often uses a binary pass/fail criteria.\nAgent evaluation uses nuanced evaluation frameworks with multiple criteria and graduated scales for performance.\nTiming\nTesting occurs (primarily) before deployment.\nAgent evaluation is done throughout the agent's full lifecycle.\nThe benefits of agent evaluation\nThe agent evaluation approach directly translates technical evaluations into business-focused insights that can be used to continuously improve AI agents and, in turn, the performance and impact of agentic automations. Agent evaluation enables leaders to make informed decisions on:\nWhen an agent is ready for production\nWhich aspects need further refinement\nHow to prioritize improvement efforts\nWhether an agent meets the organization's quality standards\nBusinesses can also ensure their AI investments deliver maximum value while minimizing implementation risks:\nRisk mitigation:\nidentify potential issues from pre-deployment to production.\nResource optimization:\nfocus improvement efforts on the most critical areas.\nQuality assurance:\nensure agents meet minimum performance thresholds.\nContinuous improvement:\ntrack progress over time through consistent metrics.\nStakeholder confidence:\nprovide transparent reporting on agent readiness.\nAgent evaluation has clear advantages over traditional testing approaches. Yet, enterprises can benefit even further when their evaluation criteria are pre-defined, and built into a structured framework and user experience.\nAgent scoring\nMany aspects must be considered to create a production-ready AI agent. You need to craft a well-structured prompt for instructing the agent. You need to choose the right tools for it to complete its tasks, and then perform sufficient evaluation for the diverse set of scenarios it may encounter. Ultimately, you might ask: how do I know if I’m on the right track to success with my agent?\nThis is where the\nagent score\nfrom UiPath comes in. Agent score is a comprehensive measurement system that examines and weights the importance of all the different elements that make up the agent.\n1. Prompt quality\nThe agent's instructions are evaluated for:\nClarity:\nhow easily understood and unambiguous are the agent’s instructions?\nCompleteness:\nare all necessary details for task execution included?\nConsistency:\ndo agent instructions align with business goals without any contradictions?\nLogical reasoning:\ndoes the agent follow a step-by-step thinking process?\nExamples:\nare the reference examples that guide agent responses of high quality?\n2. Tool use\nEvaluates the agent's available tools and resources:\nAppropriate scope:\ndoes the agent have the right number of tools? (ideally under 20)\nDocumentation quality:\nare there clear explanations of each tool's function?\nRelevance:\ndo the  tools and context sources used by the agent directly support business tasks?\nEscalation mechanisms:\nare there clear pathways for handling edge cases?\nCompleteness:\ndoes the agent have all the resources needed to perform well?\n3. Input schema\nEnsures proper configuration for business data processing:\nArgument processing:\nare user inputs correctly handled?\nPlaceholder alignment:\nare the agent’s input parameters properly configured?\nData validation:\ndo agent inputs meet the required specifications?\n4. Evaluation diversity and performance\nAssesses how thoroughly the agent has been tested:\nTesting depth:\nthe agent is run through a minimum of 30 unique test scenarios.\nTest coverage:\nare all tools and functions properly tested?\nBusiness relevance:\ndo the tests align with actual business tasks?\nDiversity:\ndo the range of scenarios reflect real-world usage?\nMeasures actual agent performance against expectations:\nAverage evaluation scores:\nprovide the overall success rate on test scenarios.\nBusiness metrics alignment:\nhow well does the agent meet specific business objectives?\nConsistency:\nhow reliable is the agent’s performance over multiple executions?\nAgent optimizer\nEvaluations and agent scoring are great, but what should you do with these results? How can you use them to make your agents better?\nThe agent optimizer from UiPath transforms agent health score metrics into specific, actionable recommendations for enhancing agent performance. It functions as an intelligent analysis system that prioritizes improvements based on impact potential, implementation effort, and alignment with business objectives.\nAcross all of the core attributes that the agent score from UiPath measures, the agent optimizer offers specific recommendations to improve the prompt, tool use/descriptions, input arguments, and evaluations. It can even apply these recommendations directly to your agent. These recommendations are delivered through\nUiPath Autopilot\n™ and its conversational interface:\nSee it in action:\nWorking together, the agent score, agent optimizer, and Autopilot deliver several benefits that accelerate time to value with UiPath Agents:\nEfficiency gains:\nmanual analysis time is reduced by instantly identifying the highest-priority improvements\nRisk reduction:\nemerging performance issues are identified early on and can be fixed before they snowball into real failures\nEnhanced ROI:\nreturn on AI investment is maximized through continuous performance improvement\nStrategic alignment:\nagent performance directly supports key business objectives and adapts optimization priorities as business needs evolve\nSee how fast and effective it is to create, customize, deploy, and evaluate coded enterprise agents using the UiPath Platform, with no complex infrastructure needed to set up or manage:\nAchieving accuracy and impact with agent evaluation\nLet’s see how agent evaluation fits into the wider agentic automation approach. Here’s a demo of agentic automation in an example loan origination process. Agent score and agent optimizer help to evaluate the performance of the loan origination agent, and provide optimization suggestions that can improve it further:\nUiPath customers are already embracing the agent evaluation capabilities of the UiPath Platform™. TQA, a technology services and consultancy leader, is using UiPath Agent Builder to create multiple internal agents for its sales and marketing teams. Agent scoring and evaluation have been a core part of the development team’s approach, giving them confidence in the performance and accuracy of their multiple agents.\nDillan Hacket, Innovation Director\n, had this to say:\n“One of things which makes the UiPath Agent Builder a truly enterprise solution is its guardrails, particularly the ability to evaluate and test the agent and its results, as well as for the agent to escalate to humans during runtime where it is unsure.\nGenAI can often be seen as a 'black box' where we aren't able to understand exactly what it is doing and therefore cannot truly trust its results to be correct and, importantly, consistent. If you ask other popular GenAI tools the same question over and over, you will likely get varying results, formats, etc. This inconsistency means that it cannot be used with confidence in an enterprise setting where we require defined, consistent, and trusted outputs and decisions.\nThe evaluation tool lets us create many different test scenarios to run through the agent and ensure its outputs are correct and consistent in all instances, giving the necessary confidence that the agent will act as expected each time, every time.”\nUiPath offers a comprehensive and differentiated approach to agent scoring. With the agent score, optimizer, and Autopilot from UiPath, businesses can evaluate, measure, and enhance AI agents across their complete lifecycle. The result is performant, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents for the enterprise—agents that understand your business and are primed to meet your objectives.\nGet started creating trusted enterprise agents that collaborate with robots and other AI agents\nusing the UiPath Agent Builder free trial\n.

We’re already using it—to write smarter emails, summarize meetings, streamline tasks, and more. What excites us isn’t just what AI can do, but how naturally it fits into the way we think and work.\nI’m part of the generation that’s grown up with technology in our pockets and generative AI tools at our fingertips. We’re curious. We’re eager. We’re experimenting. Yet in many workplaces, we’re also cautious. Not because we don’t want to embrace AI, but because we don’t know if we’re allowed to.\nTo the executives reading this: if you want to build AI-fluent, future-ready teams, you need more than guidelines and tools. You need cultures where learning is encouraged, mistakes are safe, and curiosity is celebrated.\nGen Z is ready for AI. The real question is, is your workplace ready for us?\nThe AI generation is here\nWe don’t need convincing. We’re already using AI.\nAccording to\nDeloitte\n, the majority of Gen Z and millennial AI users believe it saves time, improves the quality of work, and enhances work-life balance. That reflects growing comfort and a strong willingness to use AI in meaningful ways.\nA 2025\nMcKinsey\nsurvey further supports this, concluding that employees are more receptive to AI than leaders realize, with Gen Z  frequently using AI and expressing eagerness to build skills. But despite our enthusiasm, many of us still use AI quietly. Why?\nBecause we're not always sure how our experimentation will be perceived.\nIn some environments, it’s unclear whether trying new tools is encouraged or considered risky. That ambiguity leads to hesitation. Instead of asking questions or sharing what we’ve discovered, we often keep our AI use to ourselves.\nWe don’t need permission to be curious. But we do need clarity and encouragement to explore that curiosity openly and confidently.\nGen Z is already using AI, but without clear support\nGallup found that more than half of Gen Z employees say their employer lacks a clear AI policy. Of those who do have one, only a fraction feel confident it’s clear. The result? We hesitate—not because we don’t want to use AI, but because we’re unsure what’s appropriate, what’s encouraged, and what might be seen as overstepping.\nA new report from MIT Media Lab's NANDA Initiative, \"The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025,\" shows just how big the gap has become. Only 40% of companies report buying workplace AI subscriptions, yet employees at 90% of those same companies say they are already using personal tools like ChatGPT to get their work, often multiple times a day, even as official company pilots remain stalled.\nThat reality reinforces what McKinsey found. Employees are already leaning on AI in their day-to-day work, often more than leaders realize. Thirteen percent of employees say they use AI for over 30% of their work, while only 4% of executives think that is happening.\nThe disconnect is real, and it does more than create confusion. It undermines confidence.\nGen Z grew up experimenting with new technology, but in the workplace, that instinct is muted when using AI feels risky. What we need is not just training or tools. We need cultures where it is safe to explore, to ask questions, and to share what we are learning.\nThe real barrier isn't training. It’s trust and safety.\nWhy psychological safety matters\nTraining matters, but it isn’t the main bottleneck. According to Deloitte, 51% of Gen Z professionals have received some form of AI training. Yet most still say they don’t feel confident applying those skills in high-visibility projects without clear manager buy-in.\nWhen employees aren’t confident that using AI is culturally safe, they don’t share what’s working. They don’t ask for feedback. Instead, they experiment quietly, resulting in fragmented insights, lost opportunities for collaboration, and limited organizational learning.\nMcKinsey reports that only 1% of companies\ntoday consider themselves “AI mature.” A major reason is lack of cross-functional alignment and a culture that embraces trial and error.\nWhen trust erodes, so does innovation\nThe\n2025 Edelman Trust Barometer\nfound a \"21-point gap in comfort with AI adoption between employees with low grievance levels (50%) and those with high grievance levels (29%).\" As trust in organizations erodes, so too does confidence in the tools those agencies promote.\nFor Gen Z, this is especially challenging.\nResearch from Jonathan H. Westover, PhD\n, shows that while our generation feels generally comfortable with AI, we often carry heightened anxiety about job security and the consequences of making mistakes. We want to be bold, but we’re still early in our careers; unclear boundaries make boldness feel risky.\nWe don’t need perfection, but we do need safe environments\nWe’re not asking for AI experts in every meeting. What we need are leaders who foster cultures where experimentation is safe, where failing fast isn’t punished, and where trying something new isn’t seen as overstepping.\nBecause at the end of the day, the biggest blocker to AI engagement isn’t a lack of knowledge. It’s fear of failure.\nCompanies that embrace “fail-cheap, learn-fast” mindsets see stronger adoption and deeper experimentation with AI tools. According to\nTime\nreports,\nexperimental cultures outperform\nwhen it comes to innovation and resilience.\nThis only works when failure is transparent and normalized.\nNormalize failure, and innovation follows\nWhen employees fear consequences for honest missteps, they retreat into silence, and that silence cuts off progress before it can begin.\nFor early-career employees, especially, silence around failure can create self-doubt and stifle creativity. If we don’t talk about what didn’t work, we miss the chance to discover what might. This is where psychological safety becomes essential.\nA decade ago, Google’s Project Aristotle famously found that psychological safety is the single most important driver of team success.\nBoston Consulting Group's research\nfound that the \"positive effects of psychological safety are particularly pronounced among women, people of color, LGBTQ+ employees, people with disabilities, and people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.\"\nPsychological safety is what empowers people to speak up, share ideas, and take intelligent risks. And it must be actively cultivated (not assumed).\nI think the best thing you can say about failure is if you have a culture that permits failure, that tolerates failure, it means you’re stretching, you’re pushing, you’re trying to innovate, you’re trying to do things that are difficult.\nAdi Ignatius, Editor in Chief,\nHarvard Business Review\nCreating a high-trust culture isn’t a “nice to have” for AI readiness. In my opinion, it’s the foundation.\nIf leaders want AI to scale across their organizations, they must lead by example—narrating their own experimentation, owning their own learning curves, and creating space for others to do the same. That means shifting the conversation from “compliance” to “curiosity,” from “don’t mess up” to “let’s see what we learn.” And that’s not just true for Gen Z.\nA call to action for leaders\nThis is your opportunity, not just to empower a generation, but to unlock the full value of AI across your workforce. Here’s how:\n1. Make curiosity visible\nTalk openly about where you’re experimenting with AI. Share what’s working, and what isn’t. When leaders model exploration, it gives the rest of us permission to do the same.\n2. Create safe structures for experimentation\nPublish clear, accessible guidelines about what’s encouraged, what’s off-limits, and where employees can go to learn. Remove ambiguity so we can focus on discovery, not worry.\n3. Celebrate learning out loud\nNormalize mistakes. Recognize when someone tries something new, even if it doesn’t go perfectly. That’s how innovation compounds.\n4. Mentor the next generation of AI explorers\nGen Z doesn’t need a perfect playbook. We need leaders who cheer us on, show us how to fail forward, and remind us that curiosity is an asset, not a liability.\nIn summary...\nThis isn’t just about Gen Z. It’s about shaping a workplace where the future of work thrives—where trust, experimentation, and innovation go hand in hand.\nThe AI generation is ready.

But early robots were fragile, isolated scripts that couldn’t scale or adapt. The introduction of the Robotic Enterprise Framework (REFramework) in the UiPath Platform™ changed that by giving developers a robust, standardized architecture to build reliable, maintainable automations, especially in high-volume, UI-driven work.\nAs organizations matured in their automation journeys, their ambitions evolved: they no longer wanted to automate individual tasks, but end-to-end processes. And with the emergence of agentic automation, where AI agents act with autonomy and reasoning alongside robots and people, a new orchestration layer has become essential. That’s where\nUiPath Maestro\n™ enters the picture.\nWhat is REFramework (and why does it matter)?\nIn response to a growing need for structure, reliability, and scalability in automation deployments, UiPath introduced REFramework. More than just a project template, REFramework represented a foundational blueprint, designed to instill best practices and enable the development of enterprise-grade automation solutions. Its arrival marked a significant step in maturing the automation landscape, providing developers with a standardized, robust, and scalable architecture.\nThe core purpose of REFramework was to address the common, recurring needs of virtually any business process automation. It introduced critical capabilities like:\nConfiguration and application management\nBuilt-in exception handling\nRetry logic\nLogging and monitoring\nQueue-based processing (via UiPath Orchestrator)\nREFramework has become the gold standard for automating high-volume, resilient, repeatable tasks, such as invoice processing, order validation, and customer relationship management (CRM) updates, especially when paired with the dispatcher/performer pattern. In this model:\nA\ndispatcher\nprocess is responsible for gathering work items (e.g., reading emails, querying a database, processing a master file) and adding them as individual ‘QueueItem’ objects to an Orchestrator Queue.\nOne or more\nperformer\nprocesses, built using the REFramework template, are usually triggered in batches, every day or when a certain number of items are queued. Each Performer retrieves a ‘QueueItem’ via the Get Transaction Data state, processes it using the logic defined in ‘Process.xaml’, and updates its status using ‘SetTransactionStatus’.\nThe ReFramework/Queue pattern effectively addressed the critical challenges of scalability and resilience for a significant class of automation problems: high-volume, homogenous, transactional processes, especially those heavily reliant on UI interactions. By treating each transaction (represented by a ’QueueItem‘) as an independent unit of work managed centrally by\nUiPath Orchestrator\n, this approach allowed businesses to automate tasks at a scale and with a level of reliability previously difficult to achieve.\nWhy we needed more than REFramework\nWhile REFramework excels at handling transactional tasks, it was never designed to orchestrate dynamic, adaptive workflows. In today’s agentic era, where AI agents work alongside robots and people and utilize a complex ecosystem of tools and systems, business processes are rarely linear or isolated.\nYou often need to:\nCoordinate decision making between agents, robots, and people\nMaintain state across long-running, multi-step workflows\nRetry or skip specific steps—without starting over\nMonitor and govern the full lifecycle of a process\nREFramework excels at processing independent transactions sequentially or in parallel via queues. Adapting it effectively for processes with inherent sequential dependencies, long-running steps, human interventions, or integration with AI components often required significant customization or workarounds. For instance, consider a process with three dependent steps: Input Order, Allocate Order, Separate Order. If an error occurs during Allocation (Step 2), simply retrying Step 2 might be insufficient; the state might require re-running Step 1.\nThe standard REFramework retry mechanism, focused on the current transaction, doesn't inherently manage such cross-step dependencies.\nDevelopers\ndevised strategies like custom progress tracking within transaction data or splitting the process across multiple interconnected queues, essentially building bespoke orchestration logic on top of the basic framework.\nFurthermore, modern business processes rarely consist solely of unattended robotic tasks. They often involve human decision making, approvals, exception handling, or collaboration with AI services for tasks like document classification or sentiment analysis. Orchestrating these diverse elements—coordinating the handoffs between a REFramework bot processing data, a human approving an exception in UiPath Action Center, and an AI model providing an analysis—lacked a native, unified layer within the traditional UiPath architecture.\nThe absence of a dedicated process orchestration layer meant that the complexity didn't disappear; it merely shifted. Instead of struggling with reliable task execution (largely solved by REFramework), developers now faced the challenge of inter-task coordination. They were forced to construct custom mechanisms (chains of queues, state management databases, intricate conditional logic etc.) to manage the end-to-end flow. This increased development time, introduced potential new points of failure, and lacked standardization.\nEnter UiPath Maestro: built for agentic orchestration\nRecognizing the growing need for true, process-level orchestration, UiPath introduced Maestro. This capability is engineered to model, implement, manage, monitor, and optimize complex, potentially long-running business processes that weave together the capabilities of AI agents, people (via Action Center), and traditional robots, including those built using REFramework.\nMaestro represents a significant expansion of the UiPath Platform's capabilities, supporting the entire lifecycle of sophisticated business processes. It introduces several key features designed to address the orchestration challenges previously discussed:\nBPMN 2.0 modeling\n: a visual, industry-standard way to design rich, branching workflows\nMulti-actor coordination\n: trigger robots, invoke AI agents, assign human tasks, all from one model\nReal-time control\n: monitor instances, adjust variables, and intervene at any step\nGovernance and trust\n: enforce enterprise controls and track performance from start to finish\nThe fundamental goal of Maestro is to transform collections of disparate automated tasks into cohesive, manageable, end-to-end business processes. This effectively ends the era of \"start-and-stop\" automation where gaps exist between automated segments. It provides the necessary framework to orchestrate long-running workflows that might span hours, days, or even months, involving multiple handoffs and system interactions.\nMaestro + REFramework: better together\nUiPath Maestro doesn’t replace REFramework—it enhances it. REFramework retains its position as the gold standard for building robust, reliable, and standardized transactional automation components, particularly for UI-intensive tasks managed via queues. Maestro acts as the conductor, orchestrating these well-built performers alongside human tasks, AI agents, and other system interactions according to the defined business process flow.\nTheir complementary roles become clear when examining how they interact:\nInvocation\n: Maestro can be a Dispatcher for a ReFramework-style RPA Performer as specific steps within a larger process model, typically using a \"Service Task\" configured to either start a job or create a queue item. This allows Maestro to trigger a Performer Robot to process a specific item or batch based on the process context.\nState management\n: Maestro manages the overall state of the end-to-end business process, handling the transitions between different steps. For example, Maestro might trigger a REFramework bot to extract data, wait for its completion, evaluate the result using DMN rules, and then either assign a validation task to a human via UiPath Action Center or trigger another bot for further processing.\nError handling levels\n: they offer different levels of error handling and recovery. REFramework provides robust transaction-level retries for system exceptions within its execution scope. Maestro adds process-level control, allowing operators to manually intervene on failed instances, retry specific steps (potentially including the invocation of a REFramework bot), skip problematic steps, or rewind the process state.\nData flow\n: Maestro manages the flow of data between different steps in the process, passing necessary inputs to invoked REFramework bots and receiving outputs to inform subsequent steps.\nThis synergy allows organizations to leverage their existing investments and expertise in REFramework. Well-tested, reliable REFramework performers built for specific tasks don't need to be discarded; instead, they can become reusable components within more sophisticated, Maestro-orchestrated processes. Maestro provides the overarching structure, context, and coordination layer—the \"glue\"—that was previously missing or had to be custom-built.\nEnterprises can use REFramework to:\nBuild reliable performers for transactional UI tasks\nLeverage queue-based processing with built-in retry, logging, and error handling\nMeanwhile, the role of Maestro is to:\nDesign and orchestrate the entire business process\nManage dependencies, human steps, and AI interactions\nCoordinate multiple REFramework robots within broader agentic flows\nTogether, they enable agentic automation at scale, combining the reliability of REFramework with the flexibility and visibility of Maestro.\nCommon scenarios where REFramework and Maestro shine together include:\nUI automation is needed but must fit into a broader, multi-step journey\nProcesses where no APIs are available, so robots extract data to trigger an agentic process\nHuman-in-the-loop tasks like approvals, exceptions, or reviews\nScenarios where AI agents can enhance the process (classifying documents, summarizing emails, making decisions, etc.)\nLooking ahead\nREFramework gave us the structure for task automation. Maestro gives us the structure for end-to-end process automation. Together, they represent the evolution of UiPath from an automation platform to a true agentic automation platform—one where AI agents, robots, and people collaborate to create transformational value in orchestrated, intelligent workflows.\nAs automation expands beyond individual robots to intelligent, end-to-end processes driven by agentic AI, Maestro provides the orchestration layer to manage complexity, while REFramework continues to deliver reliable execution at the task level.\nThe future of enterprise automation on the UiPath Platform involves leveraging both:\nREFramework for building efficient, maintainable, and resilient execution units, especially for queue-based UI automation performers, adhering to established best practices for logging and error handling\nMaestro for modeling, orchestrating, monitoring, and optimizing the complex, long-running business processes that connect these performers with employers and AI agents, providing visibility and control over the entire value chain\nThis combined approach allows organizations to protect their existing investments in REFramework-based automations while embracing the power to automate more complex, strategic, and impactful business processes. As the trend towards agentic automation accelerates, where AI agents take on more sophisticated planning and execution roles, the need for a robust orchestration layer like Maestro becomes even more critical to ensure controlled, governed, and efficient end-to-end automation. The path forward lies in combining structured, reliable performers with intelligent, flexible process orchestration.\nTo learn more about how UiPath orchestrates AI agents in governed, end-to-end processes with robots and people,\nread \"The definitive guide to agentic orchestration.\"\nNever miss a T\nechnical Tuesday blog post\n!\nSubscribe to the blog\nand we'll email the latest blog posts to you every Friday.\nTopics:\nTechnical Tuesday\nAgentic orchestration\nAgentic\nAutomation\nAndrei\nVintila\nPrincipal Product Manager\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nProduct and Updates\nSeptember 9, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: Bridging traditional automation and agentic autonomy\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 5, 2025\nGoodbye workarounds: UiPath delivers native automation for macOS\nProduct and Updates\nJuly 29, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: Should you process your enterprise documents with LLMs?\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSubscribe\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSign up today and we'll email you the newest articles every week.\nThank you for subscribing!\nThank you for subscribing!

It's about enabling smarter decisions, accelerating innovation, and delivering seamless experiences. But it all  hinges on one thing: data.\nData is the fuel for automations and AI agents. And yet, across most organizations, data remains fragmented, duplicated, or locked away in siloed systems and custom applications. That's where UiPath Data Fabric comes in.\nFormerly known as Data Service, UiPath Data Fabric marks a strategic evolution—a unified data layer purpose-built for connecting data for agentic automation. It empowers organizations to model, manage, and orchestrate both UiPath-generated and external data, without copying or migrating anything.\nWhy Data Fabric? Why now?\nAs agentic automation becomes the new operating model for enterprises, the need for real-time, context-rich data has never been more urgent. AI agents are transforming how work gets done—autonomously making decisions, executing tasks, and collaborating across systems. But to function effectively, these agents require immediate access to accurate, connected data from across the business. And that’s where things can get sticky. An example might help to illustrate why.\nLet’s say you’re deploying an AI agent to assign your salespeople to new accounts. Seems simple—until you realize that data about each seller is scattered across half a dozen systems.\nTheir tenure, start date, and location live in an HR platform like\nWorkday\n. Their account assignments are tracked in Salesforce. Their product expertise and training history? Stored elsewhere entirely. Worse yet, each system may use a different identifier for the same person.\nFor an AI agent to access or update these records, it has to navigate a web of siloed data, mismatched schemas, and integration bottlenecks.\nIn the past, you’d be forced to copy and migrate data into a centralized repository, build and maintain complex pipelines, and wrestle with fragile schemas that break under pressure (especially in high-volume, real-time scenarios).\nNow, UiPath Data Fabric changes everything. It connects disparate systems in real time—no duplication, no migrations—creating a unified, contextual profile of each seller.\nYour AI agent can instantly understand a seller’s workload, experience, and training across systems, and make smart, dynamic decisions (like assigning the right rep to the right account, automatically). Need to adjust for seller vacations, certifications, or changing territory rules? Rule-based automations can tap the same real-time info from Data Fabric to keep operations flowing smoothly.\nAnd it's not just for sellers. With Data Fabric, you can build unified profiles for products, accounts, or any critical entity, unlocking the full power of AI and automation across your enterprise.\nZero-copy delivers mega-impact\nData Fabric is the foundational layer that powers agentic automation at scale—delivering zero-copy, real-time integration with both UiPath-generated and external enterprise data. A zero-copy approach addresses two fundamental challenges with handling data:\nEliminates the need for data migrations, cutting down the time and complexity of accessing data\nEnsures access to real-time data, mitigating the risks of using stale or outdated data\nBy eliminating the delays and duplication of traditional ETL pipelines, Data Fabric ensures that every agent and automation runs with the most current, trusted business context—from\nSAP\n® and\nSalesforce\nto Snowflake and many more systems. Soon, we plan to connect with databases as well.\nPaired with\nUiPath Maestro\n™, which orchestrates agents and automation flows, Data Fabric transforms disconnected data into a live, unified resource that fuels faster decisions, end-to-end automation, and smarter outcomes without the heavy lift of custom integrations. It’s not just about accessing data faster; it’s about making automations more intelligent, scalable, and aligned with how modern enterprises operate.\nDefine entity relationships visually with interactive data modeling—no code needed\nWhat makes UiPath Data Fabric different?\nData Fabric is integrated with UiPath Autopilot™ so you can simply describe the data you need—what systems and relationships—and it automatically builds the schema and unified data model. In minutes, your data is ready to use across the UiPath Platform™, from UiPath\nApps\nto Maestro to\nAI agents\n. This means less effort organizing data, and more time acting on it (and doing it all securely and at scale). Unlike traditional integration tools, with UiPath Data Fabric, you can:\nBreak down silos and unify data\nCreate a unified, connected data model that brings together UiPath-generated data and enterprise data across your organization. Unified enterprise data enables faster, improved decision making and accelerates your digital transformation.\nStreamline data modeling with built-in tools\nDesign and deploy structured data layers faster with intuitive support for entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), UiPath Autopilot–generated models, and out-of-the-box templates tailored to industry use cases. Data Fabric also enables you to standardize data definitions across agents, apps, and automations to structure data and maintain consistency across your organization.\nAchieve faster time to value\nRapidly scale automation across departments with a centralized data layer while leveraging the power of UiPath Maestro to coordinate agent tasks. With Data Fabric, you can reuse data models to reduce duplication of effort, accelerate deployment of new use cases, and ensure consistent data governance across the organization.\nEnhance security and control\nWith Data Fabric's built-in role-based access control (RBAC), easily govern who can view and modify data at the entity, field, or even row level.\nBring in external data with a simple click-to-connect setup\nSeamless integration. Unified orchestration.\nUiPath Data Fabric integrates with the rest of the UiPath Platform. And your automations, agents, and apps can consume data as if it's managed locally, even when it resides in external systems.\nDefine and reuse your data structures across multiple workflows\nModel complex business data using rich field types (text, date, number, choice sets, relationships)\nEnforce policies with RBAC\nOrchestrate enterprise-wide processes with confidence and agility\nA foundation for agentic automation\nAs agentic automation emerges—and autonomous AI agents step up to perform tasks, make decisions, and adapt dynamically—real-time, trustworthy data becomes a prerequisite. UiPath Data Fabric provides the unified foundation these agents need to act independently across systems. It ensures your agents and workflows operate on real-time insights, pulling from the most relevant systems, without any manual intervention.\nUiPath Data Fabric is a strategic shift for enterprises looking to modernize how they use and manage data in automation.

We’re tremendously excited about this event, because it not only allows us to bring new vertical offerings to our UiPath customers, but it’s also a great strategic fit with our broader agentic automation strategy. When combined with the UiPath Platform™, Peak will represent the introduction of our first vertically specialized agents that are optimized around industry-specific use cases, delivering incredible time to value and bigger outcomes to customers.\nA quick peek at Peak\nPeak is an AI-native company focused on ‘decision intelligence,’ a field combining data science, machine learning (ML), and business logic to make complex business decisions actionable.\nDecision intelligence capabilities make it faster and simpler for both AI experts and business users to leverage AI models in decision streams. Peak also offers specialized agentic solutions enabling companies in manufacturing, retail, and consumer packaged goods (CPG) to dynamically optimize inventory and product pricing in real-time.\nThese out-of-the-box solutions combine a data model with configurable AI workflows, key predictive models, and constraint templates for business logic. Specialized AI agents gather and transform data, apply models, and formulate recommendations in real time or on demand. Recommendations are presented to decision makers via clear dashboards that include supporting analyses and scenarios.\nPeak is one of a handful of innovative AI-native companies providing vertical agentic solutions for specific domains and industries. Its offerings—focused on pricing and inventory, where improvements can quickly boost both bottom lines and customer satisfaction—offer significant value to a wide range of customers.\nThe synergies behind our strategy\nThe Peak acquisition is a strategic move that provides substantial benefits to both UiPath and Peak customers. Peak’s capabilities are a natural extension of our path to agentic automation and agentic orchestration. Combining AI agents, models, automations, and humans-in-the-loop, we can build robust enterprise-grade agentic processes together.\nThis acquisition also supports our strategy of leveraging specialized enterprise agents in industry-specific agentic solutions. The combined UiPath and Peak offering delivers specialized agents that empower industry executives and their teams with intelligent, data-driven decision making and automation capabilities. What’s more, we’ve already developed successful Peak integrations and connectors—ensuring that our technologies can work together for the mutual benefit of all our customers.\nFinally, there’s the SAP® factor. Like UiPath, Peak has seen success with large, complex SAP installations. Given the UiPath partnership with SAP and our elite designation as one of only a handful of SAP Solutions Extension Partners—as well as the heightened relevance of pricing and inventory to so many SAP customers—this is an opportunity for us to go deeper in the SAP install base.\nAs for Peak, it now has an opportunity to expand quickly from its primarily UK customer base to a global market. It can quickly benefit from our go-to-market reach and the existing relationships with our thousands of manufacturing, retail, and CPG customers around the world. Plus, our automation capabilities extend the reach and value of Peak’s solutions by allowing customers to quickly automate post-decision activities and workflows (for example, once a person accepts a given pricing recommendation, automatically generating notifications and updating financial, sales, and ERP systems).\nBut are the mutual benefits really real?\nWe’re convinced of the benefits—because we’ve seen them play out in the real world. Here’s an example: our joint success story with Heidelberg Materials.  With more than 51,000 employees at almost 3,000 sites in over 50 countries, Heidelberg Materials is one of the largest integrated manufacturers of building materials in the world.\nHeidelberg Material’s United Kingdom (UK) operations were fielding 40,000+ quote requests per year. In the commoditized building materials market, rapid response is critical. But Heidelberg Material’s process—where human reps compiled data, analyzed it, computed figures, and built a quote in SAP—was taking an average of eight hours.\nThe combined UiPath and Peak solution has changed all that. Collating data from SAP ECC is now fast, accurate, and fully automated for Heidelberg Materials, thanks to UiPath intelligent data processing (IDP) and communications mining capabilities. This data goes directly to Peak’s quote pricing optimizer solution, which analyzes customer requests, simulates conversion likelihood at different price/margin combinations, and formulates an optimal price recommendation. A UiPath Robot then passes this recommendation back to the salesperson in their SAP interface.\nThis automated end-to-end process is driving big uplifts in sales team efficiency, quote conversion rates, and net margin. The average time from request to quote has been cut 90+%, from eight hours to a half-hour. And with the optimal price for conversion and margin baked into every deal, conversions have improved by 2%.\nWhat’s ahead for Peak and UiPath?\nAs we look toward the future, we couldn’t be more excited about this new opportunity to unleash the benefits of agentic automation in a specific, targeted, tangible way.  And we’re delighted to welcome the Peak team—and their customers—to the UiPath family.\nIf you’d like to learn more about agentic automation and enterprise agents for your business,\njoin us at the upcoming Agentic AI Summit\n.\nTopics:\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nAutomation\nAgentic\nAgentic orchestration\nMark\nGeene\nSVP, Product Management\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nProduct and Updates\nSeptember 9, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: Bridging traditional automation and agentic autonomy\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 12, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: How UiPath Maestro and REFramework work better together\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 5, 2025\nGoodbye workarounds: UiPath delivers native automation for macOS\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSubscribe\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSign up today and we'll email you the newest articles every week.\nThank you for subscribing!\nThank you for subscribing!

As companies seek greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness, a significant transformation is underway in procurement.\nWelcome to the era of agentic automation: a\npowerful combination of AI agents, robots, and people\nthat's reshaping how businesses manage their purchasing processes from end to end.\nBeyond AI: the agentic automation advantage\nEnvision a world where your procurement team isn't bogged down by tedious tasks, where strategic decisions are driven by real-time data, and where your entire supply chain operates seamlessly. This isn't a distant dream—it's the reality that AI agents are making possible today.\nWhile many companies are touting the benefits of AI agents alone, UiPath is taking a more comprehensive approach. We understand that true transformation comes from the perfect synergy of artificial intelligence, automation, and human insight. This is what we call\nagentic automation\n—a holistic solution that's greater than the sum of its parts.\nTraditionally, the\nprocure-to-pay process\nhas been fragmented, with different tools handling various aspects of purchasing. From sourcing and supplier management to contracting and payments, each step often operates in isolation. But what if there was a way to unite these elements into a cohesive, intelligent ecosystem?\nThe agentic automation ecosystem: AI agents, robots, and people\nAI agents are not just about automating tasks; they are about transforming entire processes. These intelligent assistants bring near-human-level reasoning and planning, revolutionizing how businesses approach procurement.\nImagine a world where your procurement team isn't just assisted by AI, but empowered by a seamless integration of AI agents, robots, and people's strategic thinking. Here's how this powerful triad is transforming procurement:\n1. Predictive demand planning: a collaborative effort\nWith agentic automation, communication breakdowns between forecasting and sourcing teams are a thing of the past. AI agents serve as the bridge, providing real-time insights that keep everyone aligned. Imagine a system that predicts your aluminum needs for auto manufacturing and alerts your sourcing managers to potential cost fluctuations. This foresight enables you to be proactive, ensuring you stay ahead in the market.\nAI agents provide real-time insights and forecasts, robots handle the data processing and integration, and people interpret the results and make strategic decisions. This collaborative approach ensures that your demand planning is not just data-driven but also nuanced with industry expertise and business acumen.\n2. Smart sourcing: from data to strategy\nThe sourcing process has long been a juggling act of phone calls, emails, and spreadsheets. With agentic automation, AI agents step in as primary coordinators, aggregating data from various sources into a single, comprehensive dashboard. But they don't stop at data collection—these intelligent assistants analyze the information, highlighting key insights, while robots automate the tedious tasks of data entry and report generation. This frees up your sourcing managers to focus on what they do best: strategic negotiations and building strong supplier relationships based on the comprehensive insights provided by the agentic automation system.\n3. Streamlined supplier onboarding: efficiency meets compliance\nThanks to agentic automation, the cumbersome process of supplier onboarding is getting a much-needed overhaul. AI agents can conduct deep research on potential partners, assess risks, and even draft supplier-specific contracts based on best practices. Robots handle the paperwork and system integrations, and people use their expertise to make the final call on partnerships. This combination ensures a fast, thorough, and compliant onboarding process that doesn't sacrifice the personal touch in building business relationships.\n4. Procurement reimagined: the intelligent purchasing ecosystem\nAI agents can autonomously conduct purchasing activities based on inventory levels. Meanwhile, robots can process orders and manage routine communications. Your team can oversee the process, handle exceptions, and focus on strategic vendor management.\n5. Financial finesse: optimizing working capital with precision\nIn the realm of payments and working capital management, AI agents are proving to be invaluable. They can perform real-time compliance checks, model various investment strategies, and provide insights that help businesses make smarter financial decisions. Robots execute routine transactions, and financial experts make informed decisions based on the insights provided. This multi-faceted approach ensures that every financial move is optimized for both efficiency and strategic impact.\nThe UiPath difference: holistic transformation\nWhile others may offer standalone AI solutions, the UiPath Platform for agentic automation provides a comprehensive ecosystem that truly transforms your procurement processes. By seamlessly integrating AI agents, robots, and people, we offer a solution that's adaptable, scalable, and uniquely positioned to meet the complex needs of modern businesses.\nThe bottom line: a competitive edge like never before\nThe integration of agentic automation into procurement processes isn't just about cutting costs or implementing the latest tech trend—it's about gaining a sustainable competitive edge in a rapidly evolving business landscape. Companies that embrace this holistic approach are seeing unprecedented improvements in efficiency, accuracy, and strategic decision making.\nThe future belongs to those who can harness the power of agentic automation to transform their business processes. The era of intelligent, robotic, and human-centric procurement is here. And it's reshaping the way we do business—one smart, automated, and strategic decision at a time.\nAre you ready to lead the charge in this new era of procurement?

By 2028,\nGartner predicts\nthey'll be included in 33% of enterprise applications. At least 15% of day-to-day decisions will soon be made by AI agents.\nIn this blog, I’ll elaborate on some of Daniel’s points, exploring the trends driving businesses to embrace these AI agents and embed them in their most critical processes. I’ll also share the impact agentic automation is already having on many market leaders, and how other enterprises can rapidly capture that same value.\nWhat’s driving the agentic revolution?\nThe business world is becoming increasingly complex, with enterprises relying on an extensive array of applications and systems to execute their processes. It's estimated that a typical enterprise utilizes more than 175 different applications and systems, presenting significant challenges in coordination, data management, and operational efficiency:\nProcess optimization complexity:\norganizations struggle to optimize workflows across interconnected systems.\nDigital transformation roadblocks:\nlegacy systems and fragmented processes often hinder tangible transformation results.\nInefficiency and manual work:\nredundant, manual tasks persist, hindering overall productivity.\nCompeting objectives:\nbusinesses must simultaneously improve efficiency, enhance customer experience, and boost employee productivity.\nMoreover, when it comes to AI implementation, businesses face additional hurdles:\nImplementation hesitation:\nthere's uncertainty around where and how to apply AI for measurable business value.\nUiPath research\nalso shows that deployment costs are a real concern, with 37% of U.S. IT leaders calling the cost of implementation a key AI challenge.\nEndless PoCs:\nmany organizations remain trapped in pilot phases, never achieving scaled impact.\nVendor lock-in fears:\nwhile enterprises can tap into multiple model and agent providers, many still feel constrained by legacy platforms—walled gardens that limit flexibility, scalability, and real return on investment.\nSkill gaps:\nthe talent needed to build, manage, and monitor AI agents is scarce and expensive to maintain.\nSecurity and compliance:\nintegrating AI without compromising regulatory standards or cybersecurity is complex. More than half (56%) of IT leaders cite security issues as a key AI challenge.\nEnter\nagentic automation\n—an advanced strategy in intelligent enterprise automation that combines advanced AI agents, traditional automation, and human decision-making capabilities. This paradigm shift enables businesses to automate complex, unstructured workflows and infuses dynamic intelligence into automation processes.\nThe business value of agentic automation\nAs Daniel Dines explains: \"Robots gave us technology to emulate how people do repetitive work. With agentic automation, this is the first time in history we have access to technology that starts to truly emulate the human mind.\"\nAdopting this new paradigm and approach offers the enterprise a range of benefits:\nOperational efficiency and productivity:\nby effectively distributing tasks among people, robots, and AI agents, organizations can accelerate turnaround times and improve productivity.\nAccuracy, consistency, and cost efficiency:\nagentic automation minimizes potential human error, promoting consistency and higher precision in both repetitive and complex tasks.\nScalability and adaptability:\nwith its modular design and continuous learning abilities, agentic automation provides a highly adaptable and scalable solution that caters to dynamic workloads and changing business needs.\nEmpowered workforce and collaborative decision making:\nby freeing people from routine tasks, agentic automation fosters focus on strategic, creative, and customer-centric tasks.\nEnhanced stakeholder experience:\nintelligent data processing aids in making informed decisions, while faster response times and improved accuracy enhance customer satisfaction.\nAgentic automation: real-world applications\nSo, how does agentic automation work in practice? Imagine a typical mortgage application process. Through agentic automation, AI agents could analyze applicant data and make initial recommendations, robots could handle document processing and data entry, while people focus on more complex cases and final approvals. This seamless collaboration can dramatically reduce processing times, improve accuracy, and enhance the client experience.\nOr consider a customer service scenario where AI agents handle initial inquiries, accessing vast knowledge bases in seconds to provide accurate responses. Complex issues could be seamlessly escalated to employees, who would have all the relevant information at their fingertips, thanks to the AI agent’s analysis.\nWhat are businesses saying?\nThe enthusiasm from UiPath customers for agentic automation speaks volumes about its potential to create unique business value. Organizations across various industries are recognizing the need for agentic automation to scale their capabilities faster and maximize the value of their employees:\n\"Leveraging agentic automation in our UiPath integration is providing massive ROIs. Exploring applications in sales and customer service is proving especially promising. These automated agents carry out the heavy lifting, allowing our sales team to focus on driving revenue. Similarly, deploying AI in customer service has measurable impacts, including substantial time savings and shorter code cycles.\"\nAkash Rana, Senior Manager IT Digital Automation, Regal Rexnord\n\"Agentic automation is certainly on our agenda for facilitating two key use cases—device processing and medical summarization. With agentic automation, we can potentially enhance our device processing capabilities. Similarly, we intend to use agentic automation to efficiently manage extensive medical records via summarization.\"\nSatyendra Satendra Shukla, Vice President, Payer Configuration & Intelligent Automation, CareSource\n\"We have a lot of complex processes like accounts payable, where we've only been able to automate parts of it. Those automations do well, but they don't span the process from one end to the other. Now with agentic automation and agentic orchestration, we can automate the entire process, end to end.\"\nChris Engel, Automation Center of Excellence – Global Discovery Lead, Johnson Controls Inc.\n\"It's about strategically pairing human capacities with agentic capabilities to maximize value for our customers. Contrary to the assumption that agents will take over completely, they'll instead handle repetitive daily tasks, transforming our approach to customer service in the future.\"\nManuel Delgado, Chief Operating Officer, Banco Azteca\nFrom enhancing decision-making processes and streamlining customer service to optimizing complex financial operations and managing medical records, agentic automation is proving to be a game-changer.\nFor more on how UiPath customers are driving transformative value with agentic automation,\ncheck out the latest\nblog from our Head of Global Customer Advocacy Janette Hausler.\nThe path forward: think big, act small\nAs exciting as this new era is, we understand that adopting agentic automation requires careful consideration and strategic implementation. We recommend a phased approach that’s driven by measured impact and proven performance:\nAssess\nthe suitability of agentic automation for your enterprise tasks.\nIdentify\nspecific workflows where it can yield substantial results.\nEngage\nwith agentic automation experts for assistance in adoption and integration.\nDeploy\nthrough a phased approach.\nContinuously monitor and optimize\nperformance.\nThe second act for business and automation\nAgentic AI is automation's second act. It empowers organizations to bring human-like intelligence into automation. To safely and responsibly build, operate, and realize transformational value from the latest of what AI can offer.\nAgentic automation also represents a second act for all enterprises. It will empower them to tackle complex challenges that were previously insurmountable. It will enable organizations to be more responsive to market changes, more attuned to customer needs, and more efficient in their operations.\nSo, embarking on the path to agentic automation isn’t a strategic decision; it's an imperative.\nWatch our launch event on demand\nto see how UiPath provides the full infrastructure to support the future of agentic automation.\nTopics:\nAgentic\nAgentic orchestration\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nFuture Of Automation\nYiannis\nBroustas\nVice President, Product Marketing\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nProduct and Updates\nSeptember 9, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: Bridging traditional automation and agentic autonomy\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 12, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: How UiPath Maestro and REFramework work better together\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 5, 2025\nGoodbye workarounds: UiPath delivers native automation for macOS\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSubscribe\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSign up today and we'll email you the newest articles every week.\nThank you for subscribing!\nThank you for subscribing!

A small team, limited resources, but unwavering dedication to our goal. We believed in something simple yet profound: people deserve to do less boring tasks and more rewarding work.\nBack then, automation wasn't what it is today. The landscape was dominated by complex, code-heavy tools that required deep technical expertise. Our vision seemed almost impossibly distant—automation that anyone could use, that could work with any application, that could mimic human actions. A robot for every person.\nThere's a moment I'll never forget from 2013 when we launched our first major product, UiPath Studio. We were using an\nopen source AI library called OpenCV\n, which, among other things, provided a feature to find a smaller image within a bigger image. We repurposed that library for automation, enabling clicking on buttons or editing text boxes. Our solution worked by screen recording an entire flow within an application, and during replay, the code would find the image of the button, calculate coordinates, and complete the action.\nI was demonstrating this product to some people who were well-versed in one of our first competitors' technologies. To achieve the same automation goal with their proprietary approach would take them two days, and the outcome wouldn't be as reliable. I remember pressing the\nRun\nbutton and within five minutes, the automation was successful—followed by complete silence. They couldn't believe their eyes.\nLooking back in time, I realize that the power of that moment came from how well we integrated various pieces of technology into a seamless product that simplified creating automation in a material way and opened up a career path for millions of automation developers.\nNobody thought what we were trying to build was possible. RPA itself seemed like a fantasy. But we weren't chasing hype—we were building technology that actually worked, that solved real problems, all powered by the accessibility and flexibility of open source innovation.\nFast forward to today, and I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about what we're launching: the first enterprise-grade platform for agentic automation. This moment echoes that breakthrough in 2013—where the seamless integration of technology creates something greater than the sum of its parts. Just as we leveraged open technologies then to create a work of beauty and precision, today's agentic automation represents the next evolution: systems that don't just follow instructions but understand context, adapt, and integrate across the entire technological ecosystem to deliver solutions that once seemed impossible.\nEmulating humans from doing to thinking\nAs an engineer at heart, I've always been fascinated by how technology works, not what sounds impressive in a pitch deck. What we built with RPA was remarkable—robots that could reliably replicate human actions.\nBut what we're launching today goes infinitely deeper, fully entering our second act.\nRobots gave us technology to emulate how people do repetitive work. With agentic automation, this is the first time in history we have access to technology that starts to truly emulate the human mind.\nThe agentic automation platform we built unifies AI, RPA, and human decision making so companies can deliver smarter, more resilient workflows without added complexity. As models and chips commoditize, the value of AI moves up the stack to orchestration and intelligence. That’s where UiPath leads.\nLet's be real about what we're facing\nI don't remember the last time so many people were so energized about a technology that could substantially change the way we work—enter agentic AI. In part, this is due to people using LLMs on a daily basis, hence assuming that AI models will be able to autonomously execute all the tasks we want them to soon enough.\nThe reality is that enterprises have yet to go past PoCs, and AI adoption is present in the automation of isolated tasks. That is because enterprise workflows have become more complex, with the average large company using over 175 different applications and systems. A business process has deterministic and non-deterministic workflows, which require different models in order to successfully automate them.\nGetting anything done requires navigating this tangled web. Meanwhile, implementing AI successfully feels like climbing a mountain—with deployment costs, security concerns, and vendor lock-in threats blocking the path forward.\nRoughly, we will have three actors delivering a process: robots, agents, and people. Each of the actors will perform specific steps: robots are best for rule based tasks, agents for unstructured information processing and decision making, while people will validate agents recommendations.\nAt the heart of today's launch is\nUiPath Maestro™\n, our agentic orchestration product, bringing together robots, agents, and people under the same framework. In this way, enterprises are able to model and monitor end-to-end processes. Maestro has process intelligence built in to provide visibility into its performance.\nI believe on humanity’s road to AGI there is a long transition when people and AI will have to collaborate. That requires working on a set of concepts that both understand. Process is one of the most fundamental constructs people use to organize work. In my view, for the foreseeable future, the most effective way to deliver automation will be through platforms like ours that enable people, robots, and AI to jointly design processes using low-code interfaces and natural language, then execute them through unified orchestration.\nOur approach with agentic automation is the same as it was with RPA: build technology that works reliably and delivers tangible ROI.\nAgents think. Robots do. People lead.\nThis simple formula has become our personal mantra. It captures exactly what we're building:\nAI agents\nthink, bringing human-like reasoning and learning to the equation\nRobots\ndo, executing tasks with precision and tireless consistency\nPeople\nlead, providing the strategic direction, creativity, and human judgment that machines can't match\nWhat sets us apart? Our orchestration engine that brings these pieces together. Think of it as the conductor of an orchestra, ensuring each instrument chimes in at exactly the right moment.\nOur approach wasn't developed in a vacuum—it was built through close collaboration with thousands of customers across every major industry. We've been in the trenches with them, understanding their processes at a fundamental level. This deep understanding of how work actually flows through enterprises gives us a unique advantage that can't be replicated overnight. That’s why we took a fundamentally different approach:\nWe have a massive installed base of robots in over 10,000 companies already running critical processes that we're now agentifying\nWe aim for our agents to achieve human-level accuracy\nYou don't need to start from scratch—we build on what you already have\nWe work with any AI model, any system and any agent—low code and pro code\nWe're just getting started\nWe are in the early innings of a fundamental transformation in how we work. Agentic automation will change the nature of jobs, redefine how we collaborate, and redefine what's possible in enterprises everywhere.\nThis isn't just about doing what we already do faster. It's about imagining what we've never been able to do before: hybrid human-agent-robot teams that co-own outcomes.\nAt UiPath, we're not just shipping agentic automation—we're agentifying ourselves. We're disrupting our own operations to respect the magnitude of this opportunity. It's that profound a shift.\nThe future of automation has arrived. And like RPA before it, what once seemed impossible is now ready for deployment. Not in some distant future, but here and now.\nWant to see what it can do for you?\nTopics:\nAgentic\nFuture Of Automation\nAgentic orchestration\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nRobots\nRobotic Process Automation (RPA)\nDaniel\nDines\nFounder and CEO\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nProduct and Updates\nSeptember 9, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: Bridging traditional automation and agentic autonomy\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 12, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: How UiPath Maestro and REFramework work better together\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 5, 2025\nGoodbye workarounds: UiPath delivers native automation for macOS\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSubscribe\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSign up today and we'll email you the newest articles every week.\nThank you for subscribing!\nThank you for subscribing!

While I used DOGE as an example in my UiPath on Tour keynote, I was building on the vision that many innovative leaders across American government agencies have been championing for years.\nHearing from these leaders across the full spectrum of government agencies about how they use our technology and what they envision they can solve with agentic automation is nothing short of amazing. The possibilities are transformative—from streamlining tax processing, to financial management teams clearing thousands of unmatched transactions, to agentic airmen, guardians, soldiers, sailors, and marines working alongside digital counterparts. At every level of government—federal, state, and local—we're seeing dedicated public servants embrace automation to fulfill their critical missions with unprecedented efficiency.\nThe Department of Government Efficiency represents an accelerated step in government transformation, aligning with what forward-thinking leaders across agencies have been working toward. For years, dedicated public servants have laid the groundwork for technological advancement, partnering with UiPath to implement automation that creates meaningful improvements. The Agentic Government concept builds on this foundation—creating a workforce where robots handle repetitive tasks, AI agents manage complex work, and people provide strategic direction. The math is simple: more digital workers = more time for human workers to focus on what matters.\nThe urgency of this transformation cannot be overstated. At our On Tour Public Sector event, we discussed a sobering reality: we need to replace 600 million labor hours in the next 6–12 months. This 45% labor gap cannot be addressed in the next 12–18 months by the people left in the public sector with the technology we have today. Consider that 35% of a government employee's time is spent on document-centric tasks. This is precisely where UiPath Autopilot™ for Everyone (now available with a 90-day trial) can make an immediate impact.\nThe\nDOGE Executive Order\naddresses key barriers through its emphasis on interoperability, data integrity, and system access. When combined with the groundwork already laid by government innovators, we can create a government where AI systems make informed decisions using data from across departments, government services anticipate citizen needs, and workflows maximize efficiency. Without agentic AI, the big shift to fanatical efficiency wouldn't be possible. We now have the technology to combine with the will to make change a reality.\nWe've always recognized that public sector organizations, led by committed government professionals, offer some of the most compelling use cases for automation. Government agencies tackle unique challenges—massive transaction volumes, regulatory complexity,  resource limitations, and rapidly growing citizen expectations. These conditions are precisely where our vision for the Agentic Government delivers its greatest impact.\nAs the \"Switzerland of agents,\" UiPath provides the vendor-agnostic orchestration layer that can unify existing and future AI investments into a cohesive system—building on the technological foundation that government innovators have established.\nThe path forward isn't without challenges. Yet together with experienced government leaders, UiPath brings solutions through our shared experience building trust frameworks, security protocols, and change management approaches. We understand that human expertise and oversight remain essential.\nAmerican government has the opportunity to lead the world in this transformation. DOGE represents an important step in a journey that many in government have been advancing for years. By embracing the agentic vision and expanding on existing foundations, American government can create the global standard for public service in the 21st century.\nUiPath is ready to continue to be a partner in this evolution. Together, we can build a government where bureaucracy decreases, citizen needs are anticipated, and public servants can focus on what truly matters—solving complex problems and serving human needs.\nThe future of government isn't merely digital—it's agentic.

Even as businesses transition to powerful agentic workflows—with AI agents, robots, and people working together—documents, communications, and other types of content will continue to underlie every enterprise process.\nIntelligent document processing (IDP) tools are firmly established within many businesses. Traditionally, IDP has helped businesses extract useful data from structured documents to deepen business and customer insights, and to drive automation in document-based processes.\nHowever, IDP has evolved to become even more useful and powerful. In this article I’ll explain what’s driving this evolution, and how IDP is using the latest generative AI (GenAI) models to turn even the most complex unstructured documents into clean, structured data.\nA complex content problem\nA significant amount of work in the enterprise depends on complicated unstructured content—think of complex documents such as legal contracts, brokerage statements, and physician statements, or unstructured communications such as product feedback, and customer queries.\nIn fact, McKinsey estimates that\n90% of all business data is unstructured\n, with a large portion coming in the form of complex documents.\nTraditionally, IDP solutions have struggled to understand and process complex, unstructured documents. This is because IDP has long depended on rules-based methods or specialized AI models pre-trained to understand and process documents in a consistent, structured schema. Think of an invoice—many clearly structured ‘fields’ where important information like customer names, dates, and invoice numbers can be found.\nCompare this to a complex contract, or a brokerage statement where key information is buried within masses of text, often without a standardized format. These complex documents are typically very long and their structures varied. They can have complex elements like nested tables, charts, images, and very long page counts, often in the hundreds.\nPre-trained IDP models have another downside—data annotation. This is where people in the business (called ‘subject matter experts’) manually label data to help the IDP model recognize the correct fields to extract. While data annotation is very useful for fine-tuning model performance, it can be time-consuming and resource intensive. Models relying solely on user annotations are hard to scale for long and complex documents, since the annotation process is long and arduous. An inference first approach using generative models is critical here to ensure time to value and scalability. Being able to turn this unstructured content into structured data, and then passing that data to an AI agent, will be incredibly valuable for enterprises and allow them to automate vastly more processes. Fortunately, a new generation of IDP solutions is helping businesses do just that!\nConquering complexity: what’s next for IDP?\nReading a document may be relatively simple for people, but it’s a very hard task for machines to do. Processing a document isn’t just about being able to extract data from document fields and complex elements like graphs and tables. You also need to understand how those individual fields relate to each other and to the document as a whole.\nUltimately, the goal in processing documents is to transform unstructured information into a well-structured schema to support analysis and automation of processes. This requires real reasoning and understanding. That’s why traditional, specialized IDP models trained to extract data from a specific schema or output won’t always work to the levels expected.\nHowever, in the last couple of years, an answer has been found. IDP solutions have begun to combine the use of specialized AI with state-of-the-art GenAI models. These are usually large language models (LLMs) similar to those powering UiPath Autopilot and Anthropic’s Claude. These LLMs are capable not just of absorbing large amounts of multi-model data, but also of reasoning and interpreting it to understand its meaning. These capabilities make LLMs ideal for more interpretive tasks where the input isn’t always fixed. That’s why they’re such a powerful tool for understanding unstructured documents and extracting their key data for insight and automation.\nBy combining structured, specialized AI with flexible GenAI, IDP solutions enable businesses to process the bulk of their enterprise data, whether it’s structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. When combined with AI agents, robots, and people, entire processes involving the most complex and unstructured documents and communications can be automated end-to-end.\nHowever, the latest IDP solutions still need to give businesses precise control over GenAI outputs. When automating document-heavy workflows, the goal is often to populate a specific format or schema with data extracted from said documents. Yet, LLM outputs can be unpredictable—counterproductive in settings where consistency and reliability are key. Getting an LLM to generate outputs in a consistent format (such as a table) requires time-consuming prompt engineering. This is where SMEs experiment with giving the model various instructions until the desired output is achieved. However, as business needs change and use cases scale, teams will soon find themselves with a massive instruction set that’s difficult to maintain.\nFurthermore, LLMs can make mistakes. They've been known to hallucinate, make up outputs, and struggle to cite sources reliably. They also don’t provide reliable confidence levels for their extractions, leading to the need for more human review. In IDP, this could take the form of extracting the wrong information or even outputting made-up data. Businesses need controls and human-in-the-loop to ensure GenAI outputs are correct so they can be used consistently and reliably by the business with a minimal amount of human review.\nIntroducing IXP\nUiPath has provided AI-enabled document processing and communications mining for years. But our approach has developed to now incorporate advanced GenAI.\nWe call our new IDP capability UiPath IXP (Intelligent Xtraction and Processing), where the ‘X’ not only represents the idea of ‘extraction’ but also a growing number of diverse content types, including complex and unstructured documents and communications. UiPath IXP is built for fast time to value and a seamless user experience to take the pain out of complex document processing of all types.\nUiPath combines the use of specialized AI models for structured documents with state-of-the-art GenAI for complex unstructured content. Our inference-first experience means you can provide the model instructions (just like a prompt) and it will extract the information you need and put it into the format you specify.\nAt the same time, UiPath IXP provides precise controls to ensure the accuracy of our IDP outputs. Users have the ability to write prompt instructions at the level of individual fields and, crucially, are given tools to evaluate model accuracy. They can engage in closed-loop learning to improve model performance and ensure outputs meet the exact requirements. This is enhanced by custom validation experiences that are tuned to specific use cases. Our models give confidence scores for every prediction so you can manually review when the model isn’t entirely sure. Finally, our models also provide attribution, giving sources and references for all their predictions.\nLearn how UiPath IXP enables enterprises to automate more and extend end-to-end automation (both agentic and traditional) into areas previously untouched.\nWatch our on-demand session from UiPath Agentic AI Summit\n.\nTopics:\nProduct Releases\nIntelligent document processing\nAgentic\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nMark\nGeene\nSVP, Product Management\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nProduct and Updates\nSeptember 9, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: Bridging traditional automation and agentic autonomy\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 12, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: How UiPath Maestro and REFramework work better together\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 5, 2025\nGoodbye workarounds: UiPath delivers native automation for macOS\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSubscribe\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSign up today and we'll email you the newest articles every week.\nThank you for subscribing!\nThank you for subscribing!

While each promises value, these systems are piling up like mismatched Lego bricks. Instead of bringing clarity and efficiency, many have introduced greater complexity.\nMost enterprises focus on quickly introducing AI agents for specific tasks such as support ticket automation and contract handling. While this approach delivers some quick wins, it leaves a lot of value on the table because it fails to address many of the root inefficiencies built into processes. Most inefficiencies in complex enterprise workflows occur between tasks—in transitions, handoffs, and manual checkpoints.\nThe rise of the enterprise OS\nWhat’s missing is the connective tissue and intelligence to manage enterprise processes end-to-end. For example, in traditional IT, an operating system doesn't merely run programs—it manages them, allocates resources, and ensures system-wide stability. Similarly, companies need an enterprise OS layer designed explicitly to track, manage, evaluate, and optimize enterprise processes.\nThat's where agentic orchestration comes in.\nAgentic orchestration acts as the enterprise OS. While the idea of orchestrating processes isn’t new, applying agentic AI enables autonomous decision-making and adaptive problem solving to bring more power to process orchestration. This OS layer integrates processes and the data, automation, and AI tools supporting them, providing observability, intelligent routing, exception handling, and built-in governance.\nAn enterprise OS isn't about centralization for its own sake: it provides distributed intelligence within a shared frame of reference. Simply layering AI onto existing workflows typically yields modest efficiency gains (around 3–5%) rather than transformative improvements. Achieving substantial productivity and value from AI requires redesigning workflows and bridging the gaps between them. For this reason, leaders are focusing 70% of enterprise AI investments on process improvements.\nAgentic orchestration\ncan expand AI’s potential from performing individual tasks to intelligently managing entire processes. When processes are explicitly mapped and defined, deploying the right automations and AI agents exactly where needed becomes simple and effective.\nGet your copy of \"The Definitive Guide to Agentic Orchestration.\"\nOrchestration is the new differentiation\nThe promise of agentic orchestration is both tactical and strategic. In the short-term, it addresses costly inefficiencies that plague complex processes: delayed handoffs, routing errors, duplicated efforts, and hidden exceptions. For example, machine learning has long been used in claims processing for data ingestion, extraction, and processing; the use of generative AI has also enabled summarizing and querying of unstructured data from documents.\nNow, with agentic orchestration, entire workflows can be managed autonomously, end to end: getting proactive and actionable process intelligence, triggering robots and agents to complete tasks, invoking models, escalating exceptions to humans, and tracking progress. This reduces cycle time, improves consistency, and enables truly scalable, lights-out claims handling.\nIn the bigger picture, agentic orchestration unlocks a new architecture for enterprise operations. It serves as a foundational layer that enables effective scaling of AI, supporting modularity and reusability. AI agents become plug-and-play across multiple workflows.\nThe orchestration layer ensures observability and auditability for compliance, offers dynamic adaptation to real-time context changes, and it provides system-agnostic interoperability—integrating seamlessly with both legacy and modern platforms. Built-in policy enforcement and governance maintain control and accountability even as AI agents increase autonomy.\nEnterprise performance is increasingly defined by how quickly and intelligently a business can execute. And this, ultimately, is the point: enterprise success won’t come from adding more isolated products; it’ll come from orchestrating them to create value.\nLearn about UiPath Maestro™ for agentic orchestration\n.\nSources:\nAnders Humlum and Emilie Vestergaard,\nLarge Language Models, Small Labor Market Effects\n, Becker Friedman Institute, April 2025.\nBoston Consulting Group,\nAI Adoption in 2024: 74% of Companies Struggle to Achieve and Scale Value\n, October 24, 2024.\nTopics:\nAgentic orchestration\nCynthya\nPeranandam\nSenior Director, Product Marketing, Agentic AI, Orchestration, Solutions\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nAI\nSeptember 8, 2025\nUiPath named a Leader in the Gartner First-Ever Magic Quadrant for Intelligent Document Processing\nAI\nAugust 6, 2025\nWhy AI agents need intelligent document processing\nAI\nJune 11, 2025\nAI agents took center stage at Microsoft Build\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSubscribe\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSign up today and we'll email you the newest articles every week.\nThank you for subscribing!\nThank you for subscribing!

Trade and compliance teams are struggling with execution—tracking, interpreting, and quickly applying every new rule and code change.\nHarmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) codes are a prime example. These global identifiers shift frequently, and when they do, reclassification needs to happen immediately. There’s no room for error, either—even a single misstep can lead to fines and reputational damage.\nIt’s a lot to manage, especially for teams that are already stretched thin. Fortunately, this is exactly the kind of complex, high-volume work agentic automation was built to tackle.\nIn this blog, we’ll explore how the UiPath Platform™ helps teams stay on top of tariff-related changes by combining the best of AI agents, robots, and people.\nThe growing challenge of manually classifying HTS codes\nClassifying HTS codes was already a heavy lift before the recent wave of tariff activity. Many importers rely on internal compliance teams or external brokers to manually research, assign, and verify codes. It’s painstaking work that’s magnified by the sizable volume of goods moving through the global supply chain.\nAdd in a volatile tariff environment, and the entire process becomes even more difficult to manage. Teams are forced to drop everything to reclassify items on short notice, often without clear guidance or sufficient time to react. That’s a recipe for costly errors that can lead to fines of up to 800% of the import’s value.\nAnd even if teams do manage to steer clear of errors, the sheer volume of work required can lead to delays. That can mean millions of dollars in lost sales as goods linger in customs limbo, as well as potential legal disputes and permanent damage to a company’s international trade reputation.\nAutomate HTS code workflows to avoid the chaos\nAs UiPath CEO Daniel Dines said in a\nWall Street Journal article\npublished February 12, 2025, “we have started to see a limit to the computing capabilities of LLMs [with RPA]. The technology is extremely powerful, but companies are realizing it is not going to scale linearly from now on—we must design smarter ways to use what we have and bring more reliability into the picture. That’s one of the reasons agentic AI is capturing so much attention: Many enterprises now see that to fully reap the benefits of LLMs, we have to find a way to deploy them autonomously as part of enterprise workflows and systems, with security and governance built in along the way.”\nUiPath agentic automation blends the best of people, robots, and AI agents to classify products in real time based on new tariff rules. Some of the benefits include:\nReduced direct customs penalties:\nAI agents are more efficient than people. Their fast decisions and documented rationale limit importers’ risk of border enforcement fines.\nFewer operational disruptions:\nimproved long-term HTS accuracy reduces the frequency and length of costly audits and freight holds.\nLower compliance and audit expenses:\nAI agents are highly configurable, giving importers full control over when and how people are involved in classification decisions.\nEnhanced reputation and market access:\nimproved long-term HTS accuracy and quick customs filings improve business relationships.\nHere’s how agentic automation simplifies the complex:\nThe agentic automation-powered UiPath HTS Code Classifier works together with UiPath Document Understanding™ to streamline the entire process.\nHere’s how it works: first, Document Understanding processes commercial invoices from overseas vendors, extracting HTS codes, product names, and descriptions. It then automatically feeds this information into the system of record.\nNext, the Classifier presents these unverified, vendor-provided HTS codes in an HTS code verifier. Then, an AI agent steps in, using the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI) to classify the imported items. Because it documents its reasoning in natural language, teams can have confidence in its verification and a clear audit trail for future reference.\nHere's how agentic automation keeps a human-in-the-loop:\nJust because AI agents are handling the heavy lifting doesn’t mean humans are absent from this process. They’re the overseers—if the confidence level for a particular code is below an established threshold, the agent automatically notifies a compliance team member to review its decision via the\nAction Center\n. If there is an issue, the team member can step in and fix it.\nNavigate tariff changes effortlessly\nFrom extracting data from key documents and performing multi-system lookups to accurately identifying HTS codes and completing the CBP declaration form, UiPath delivers an end-to-end solution that streamlines the entire HTS code process.\nKeeping a human-in-the-loop is a real difference-maker here. Unlike traditional set-it-and-forget-it automation workflows, the UiPath HTS Code Classifier cues in trade professionals to the sources, logic, and outputs generated by AI agents. This built-in audit trail ensures your entire workflow stays transparent, compliant, and verifiable.\nWe know that importing goods into the United States (U.S.) can be a headache, especially with tariffs constantly in flux. UiPath agentic automation keeps you one step ahead of all these changes, so that when a team member does need to step in, they can do so immediately.\nReady to see more?\nWatch our 20-minute solution demo\nwebinar on demand.\nTopics:\nAgentic\nFinance & Accounting (F&A)\nDocument Understanding\nAction Center\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nCaleb\nJones\nStrategic Engagement Executive\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nIndustry Solutions\nJuly 21, 2025\nAgentic, not fragmented: how AI agents unify the contact center\nIndustry Solutions\nMay 21, 2025\nStill running AI agents and RPA in silos in financial services?

This feature allows customers to integrate any model hosted as a service on Microsoft Azure, AWS, GCP, or provider like Fireworks AI into the UiPath AI Trust Layer seamlessly. This integration ensures that customers can leverage their preferred models while benefiting from the secure and trusted UiPath Platform.\nBring large language models (LLMs) into the UiPath Platform, and you inherit all of the platform’s AI guardrails and governance capabilities. Every interaction is fully auditable end-to-end, with in-flight personally identifiable information (PII) filtering—now in public preview—or via dedicated activities so you can sanitize sensitive data seamlessly. On top of that, your LLMs run within the robust UiPath security framework, benefiting from the same enterprise-grade AI Trust Layer that safeguards all of our agentic automation projects.\nThe feature brings choice, control, and customization to customers. In agentic automation, where AI isn’t just a tool but an active collaborator, UiPath empowers you to ensure your models align with both innovation and governance. Whether you’re managing costs, ensuring compliance, or pursuing AI sovereignty, BYOM gives you the flexibility to choose your models, own your infrastructure, and define how AI works for you—on your terms.\nBuilding agents with custom models\nOur BYOM feature offers two powerful ways to tailor your AI experience to meet your strategic and operational goals:\nBring your own subscription\n: replace UiPath-managed AI subscriptions with your own, as long as the model matches the supported family and version. This option gives you complete control over your AI usage and costs—while still benefiting from the scalability, security, and integration of the UiPath Platform.\nBring your own LLM\n: use any LLM that meets UiPath compatibility standards. With the OpenAI V1 Compliant LLM connector, you can easily integrate models from Fireworks AI, Grok, or any inference provider following the OpenAI API format. A simple probe call ensures the model is ready to power AI agents within the UiPath Platform.\nFor instance, customers can deploy their model as a service in Fireworks, generate an OpenAI API compliant link, and make the model available to UiPath developers in the UiPath AI Trust Layer.\nOnce the model is deployed, it can be selected while building your agent in\nUiPath Agent Builder\n. This feature provides customers with the flexibility to choose models that best fit their use case, taking into consideration language requirements, model performance, and cost. Agent units for running agents that utilize third-party models will be given a discount compared to ones using the out-of-the-box models available in Agent Builder.\nWe are working on making these models available  for UiPath IXP (Intelligent Xtraction & Processing) for extraction of documents and emails, UiPath Autopilot™ for Everyone, and generative AI activities within UiPath Integration Service activities, further enhancing the versatility and applicability of their custom models.\nCollaboration with Fireworks AI\nThrough our partnership with Fireworks AI, UiPath also offers access to a library of more than 170 high-performance models, optimized for speed, cost efficiency, and domain-specific use cases. Customers are already using Fireworks AI to bring open-source models into their AI solutions in a performant, cost-effective way. For example, a customer who has fine-tuned a Mistral model for medical record extraction in French and English can now make the model available on UiPath Platform via Fireworks AI. Customers using Fireworks have seen significant performance benefits on models like\nDeepSeek v3\n, achieving speeds up to 130 tokens/sec or costs as low as $0.55/ million input tokens.\nFireworks CEO Lin Qiao remarked \"We are excited to bring industry-leading LLMs in a performant and cost-effective way and enable customers to build powerful, enterprise-ready agents on the UiPath Platform.\"\nMark Geene, SVP of Product at UiPath, said “Our customers are excited about the choice they get with bring-your-own-model feature in AI Trust Layer and with partnerships like Fireworks.”\nWhether you’re prioritizing regional deployment to meet data residency laws, scaling automation across global teams, or building AI agents aligned with internal compliance policies, UiPath delivers unmatched flexibility and performance in a single, unified agentic automation platform.\nWith UiPath BYOM, you’re not just connecting models—you’re building an AI foundation that’s open, sovereign, and future-ready.\nBring Your Own Model is now\ngenerally available in UiPath AI Trust Layer\n.\nTry it today\n.\nTopics:\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nIntegration Service\nProduct Releases\nAgent Builder\nBogdan\nZavera\nProduct Manager\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nProduct and Updates\nSeptember 9, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: Bridging traditional automation and agentic autonomy\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 12, 2025\nTechnical Tuesday: How UiPath Maestro and REFramework work better together\nProduct and Updates\nAugust 5, 2025\nGoodbye workarounds: UiPath delivers native automation for macOS\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSubscribe\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSign up today and we'll email you the newest articles every week.\nThank you for subscribing!\nThank you for subscribing!

But once they’re embedded, the impact is incredible. I love hearing from UiPath customers like Ainara Etxeandia Sagasti, Head of the Digital Services at Lantik, who’s \"combining RPA, generative AI, and agentic technology [to make] public services more accessible, efficient, and citizen-focused than ever.\" Already, more than 10,000 AI agents have been built on the UiPath Platform™. Agents can transform process efficiency and profitability, but they need strong orchestration and help from automation and humans in the loop.\nIn this blog post, I’ll cover the most common\npain points\nwhen building, testing, or deploying AI agents at scale. I’ll also explain how an orchestrated approach—built on\ncontrolled agency\nand interoperability\n—can mitigate them.\n1. Performance and reliability of agents\nDevelopers and users frequently cite the unreliability of AI agents as a barrier to production. Large language models (LLMs) make agents flexible and adaptable, but this also leads to inconsistent outputs. This can frustrate development and testing. As\none engineer put it\n,\n“My agents sometimes work perfectly, then completely fail on similar inputs. We need better ways to simulate edge cases and reproduce failures consistently… monitoring agent ‘drift’ over time is a real headache.”\nAnother challenge is\nhallucinations\n—agents making up facts or tool inputs—which can grind processes to a halt. A\nuser building AI workflows shared\n:\n“The biggest pain points we find are repeatability and hallucinations… ensuring that for the same or similar queries the LLM agents don’t go off the rails and hallucinate inputs to other tools.”\nThis unpredictability needs extensive testing and validation, but agent testing tools are immature. When errors occur, they can be hard to diagnose due to opaque model reasoning. This causes teams to be\nextremely cautious about changes\n:\n“We’re so wary of system prompt changes at this point because we’ve been burned by telling the agent not to do something and then it starts behaving weird… so many times.”\nThe\nperformance\nof underlying AI models is another problem. Large models can be resource-intensive or slow, while smaller models might not perform as well. Finding the right balance is challenging.\nA lack of consistent, reliable outputs makes it difficult to\ntrust\nAI agents with mission-critical or customer-facing tasks without extensive safeguards. In practice, achieving high reliability often requires simplifying agent behaviors, introducing strict constraints, or having fallbacks (like constant human intervention). Yet, these measures tend to compromise agent autonomy, efficiency, and therefore utility in value-adding enterprise scenarios.\n2. Controlled agency and human-in-the-loop\nWhile AI agents can automate complex tasks, developers find that\nhuman oversight and collaboration\nare essential—and striking the right balance is hard. Fully hands-off autonomy is often impractical because agents can make mistakes or unclear decisions. Enterprises need  control over the degree of agency, which can increase over time as agents get more accurate and reliable.\nA common approach is to keep a \"human-in-the-loop” for certain approvals or to handle edge cases, but this can slow processes if not well-orchestrated. Then, a “human-in-the-loop” is called for certain approvals, critical decisions, and to handle exceptions.\nOne AI engineer noted\nthat constraining agents and involving humans leads to better outcomes: “Tightly constrained LLMs with human oversight can achieve good results for medium-complex tasks… [Fully] autonomous, general-purpose agents [at scale]”\naren’t yet realistic.\nOn the flip side, if the AI is too tightly controlled or requires constant checking, it doesn’t create ROI. Sometimes, an agent can interrupt workflows or create more effort than it saves. For example,\none developer explained\nhow coding Copilot disrupted productivity by forcing manual corrections:\n“It begins something but fails to finish it… I have to divert my attention to checking and closing the tags, parentheses, etc. It disrupts my flow, slowing me down.”\nThe challenge is designing hybrid workflows where agents handle the work but seamlessly hands off to humans for judgment calls—without creating extra friction.\n3. Cost and ROI concerns\nThe ROI of AI agents is a recurring concern, especially as usage scales. Large language model APIs (and the infrastructure to run them) can be expensive. Teams worry about\ncost blowouts\nif agents are not optimized.\nOne user claimed\nthat current agents are\n“too expensive”\nfor what they achieve. ROI can be hard to measure when reliability is low. If an agent only succeeds part of the time, the cost of its failures (and manual fixes) can outweigh the benefits.\nEnterprises are trying to control costs through methods like model optimizations and usage policies.\nOne user described\nimplementing caching to reduce repeated calls and carefully sourcing high-quality data to improve output efficiency.\nOthers focus on choosing the right model\nfor the job:\n“I would [love] a framework where I can have my prompt… run it across all different models, [and] find the best and cheapest. Right now my AI agent uses over 200 prompt templates, and testing and retesting them all is expensive.”\nUltimately, prompt engineering and model experimentation incur real costs.\nVendor pricing models\n(per token, per call, etc.) also play a role. For example, using GPT-4 for everything might be overkill, but using a cheaper model could reduce quality. Teams must strike a balance to justify ROI. Furthermore, management might question the business value of agent projects if they require significant ongoing spend on cloud AI services or specialized infrastructure. Without clear wins (either in revenue gain or cost savings from automation), investment can be hard to defend. Thus, optimizing cost and demonstrating ROI\nare front of mind\n—teams want to\n“get the cheapest bang for my buck”\nwith AI agents by mixing and matching models while focusing on high-value use cases.\n4. Governance, security, and privacy concerns\nOrganizations must enforce security, compliance, and ethical guidelines on AI agents, but this is easier said than done.\nData privacy\nis a top concern—many companies\nban or restrict cloud AI services\nuntil they’re confident sensitive data won’t leak.\nOne developer shared\nthat their workplace forbids tools like ChatGPT because of intellectual property risks:\n“No. It is deemed too much of an IP risk, [fearing] it might leak our secrets or violate someone else’s copyright.”\nWhen using third-party AI APIs, practitioners worry about customer data inadvertently being sent to those services.\nSecurity\nis another issue: autonomous agents pose a risk if not properly sandboxed. There are\nreports of teams adding extra safeguards\non top of agent platforms—for example,\n“we had to add [a] security layer on top… [and] use caching (Redis) for cost optimization”\nwhen deploying a lead generation agent. Out-of-the-box solutions often lack enterprise-grade security controls or cost management, and companies must bolt on their own governance. Additionally, ensuring agents comply with regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) and follow organizational policies is difficult if agent frameworks don’t provide hooks for oversight.\nThese concerns\nmake stakeholders cautious\n: they want AI agents to be powerful, but transparent and controlled\n“with neutral, universally accepted protocols rather than proprietary systems”\nthat hide how data is used. In short, without robust governance features (audit logs, permission controls, human override, etc.), many organizations hit a wall in wider agent deployment.\n5. Deployment and scaling difficulties\nMoving an AI agent from proof-of-concept to production can introduce a host of issues. Users report that what works in a controlled demo often struggles with real-world scale, volume, and complexity. Common concerns include\nlatency and throughput\n(LLM-powered agents can be too slow for high-traffic or real-time applications) and the operational overhead of running the system reliably. As Adrian Krebs, Co-Founder & CEO of Kadoa,\nput it\n,\n“It doesn’t matter if you’re using [an] orchestration framework if the underlying issue is that AI agents [are] too slow, too expensive, and too unreliable.”\nTeams often need to rearchitect for efficiency—using caching, swapping models, or simplifying agent logic—just to meet performance requirements.\nThere’s also the challenge of deploying across environments (cloud, on-premises, edge devices) while maintaining consistency. In enterprise settings, not all departments will want to use the same tools, which makes standardized deployment harder.\nOperational scaling\nissues like monitoring, logging, and updating agents in the field are likewise underdeveloped.\nOne Reddit user noted\nthat even basic debugging can be\n“a nightmare… error logs are often cryptic, with no clear troubleshooting guide.”\nThis only gets tougher when many agents are deployed. All this can slow agent adoption. Even\nmajor vendors have admitted\nthat customers are\n“just getting started”\nand meaningful at-scale results are still emerging.\n6. Multi-agent orchestration complexities\nBuilding systems where multiple AI agents collaborate is tricky. Developers struggle with coordinating agent roles, managing shared state, and preventing agents from getting stuck in loops or conflicting with each other. Even with orchestration frameworks, a misstep in one agent’s output can derail an entire workflow. As\none developer claimed\n,\n“People are just experimenting. The unreliability is still a major issue: any derailing in the auto-regressive generation process can be fatal for an agent.”\nOthers stress the difficulty of creating self-healing or resilient workflows—for example, adding logic to retry failed steps or human intervention.\nThese orchestration challenges mean teams often end up fixing one issue\nonly for others to appear\n:\n“Sometimes it even feels like whack-a-mole. Fix one issue with some prompt engineering and then create three more.”\n7. Model compatibility and integration challenges\nNo single AI agent is dominant in the market. Organizations might use OpenAI one day, switch to an open-source model the next, and integrate various third-party tools. But compatibility and smooth integration is a major challenge.\nTool and model integration\noften requires custom adapters or glue code. For example, connecting an agent to a proprietary database or an internal API can involve significant effort if the framework wasn’t designed with that in mind.\nDevelopers argue\nthat many frameworks are “heavy” and come with assumptions that don’t fit all use cases:\n“Unfortunately many of these frameworks are pretty heavy if you just need basics.”\nConversely, going “framework-agnostic” often means writing a lot of boilerplate from scratch. Users want to avoid reinventing the wheel without getting locked in. One\ndeveloper described\nsettling on a more flexible library specifically to maximize compatibility:\n“I tried a lot… Eventually I settled for using\n[Instructor]\n, because I could quickly switch between LLMs – both local/OS and proprietary – and I could have the same structured input/output everywhere.”\nThis highlights the need for agents that allow easy swapping of AI models or services to meet evolving needs.\nAnother common need is integrating agents with existing software stacks and workflows. A lack of\nstandard interfaces\nmeans each new agent might require a new integration effort.\nAs noted\n, missing examples and advanced setup can hinder this. Furthermore, compatibility issues arise when an update to one component (e.g. an LLM API change) breaks the agent’s logic—something teams have to actively manage. In short, practitioners want\nplug-and-play interoperability\n: AI agents that connect with various models, data sources, and systems without extensive custom engineering.\n8. Vendor lock-in and interoperability issues\nAI models and frameworks are changing fast. Many teams want best-of-breed and worry that choosing a single vendor’s AI agent solution could make them inflexible down the line. There’s an explosion of agent frameworks, each with its own APIs and considerations. One\ndeveloper compared it to\nthe JavaScript framework craze:\n“In a few months we’ll probably have our version of ‘TODO app in 100 different JS web frameworks’…Even just understanding them all is a huge task.”\nCommitting to one ecosystem can mean\nlimited flexibility\n. Certain libraries favor specific providers. For instance, a\nfrustrated user warned\ntheir choice of framework\n“mainly breaks,”\nhighlighting how some tools implicitly lock you into particular models or services. The\nrisk is building around a vendor’s vision\nand later finding yourself\n“locked in – dependent on its updates, pricing, and policies, with no viable alternative.”\nInteroperability is also a concern for integrating agents into existing software stacks.\nDevelopers often find\n“no clear examples”\nto hook agents into languages and cloud services they already use, making it harder to adopt these tools across diverse teams.\nOpportunities with agentic orchestration\nMany of these challenges point to a need for\nagentic orchestration solutions\nthat are flexible, interoperable, and human-centric. Agentic orchestration effectively manages, assigns tasks, and responsibilities among people, robots, and AI agents depending on their capabilities, ensuring operations are smooth, efficient, and aligned with the business’s strategic outcomes.\nAn orchestration layer that effectively integrates reliable AI agents, deterministic automation, and human inputs offers several advantages:\nImproved reliability via deterministic backstops:\nthe ideal end state of the orchestrated approach is controlled agency, which allows for optimal efficiency without excessive manual intervention. This depends on the orchestration of specialized AI agents that are carefully constrained in processes by enterprise-grade tools, deterministic robots, and a comfortable level of human review. By combining AI agents with deterministic automation scripts or rules, an orchestration layer ensures there’s always a fallback path. For example, if an AI agent’s output doesn’t meet a certain accuracy threshold, a predefined rule might handle that case (or at least flag it). This hybrid approach leverages the creativity of AI but within guardrails. Over time, an orchestration platform could even learn which agent is most reliable for which task (through monitoring outcomes) and route tasks accordingly, thereby\noptimizing success rates\n. The net effect is higher overall reliability of the workflow compared to a single black-box agent. As\none developer noted\n,\n“tightly constrained [agents] with human oversight”\nand well-defined processes can yield\nreliably good results\n—exactly what orchestration enables.\nHuman-in-the-loop integration:\na key benefit of a well-designed orchestration layer is the ease of weaving in human checkpoints. For instance, the orchestration layer can be configured to pause and request human approval if an agent’s confidence is low or its decision has high stakes. This provides the 'safety net' needed to deploy agents in critical workflows. Instead of hard-coding human oversight separately for each agent, the common platform can offer a consistent interface for escalation to humans, and even learning from human corrections over time. This alignment of\nAI + human workflows\nhelps leverage AI speed where appropriate, but always with a human backstop to ensure reliability and trust.\nCentralized governance and security:\na vendor-agnostic orchestration layer can enforce security and compliance uniformly across all AI activities. It can serve as a gateway that monitors what data is sent to each agent, scrub or anonymize sensitive information, and log all agent decisions for audit purposes. This addresses the governance concerns by giving organizations a single point of control: for example, administrators could configure which AI models are allowed to handle certain data, or require that certain queries always be handled by an on-premises model due to privacy policies. Such a system could also integrate with identity and access management (IAM) for role-based control over agent actions.\nPolicies\n(like rate limits or cost budgets) could be applied globally. All these capabilities mean enterprises can adopt AI agents more confidently, knowing there's an oversight layer to prevent unwanted data leaks or rogue behavior.\nInteroperability and avoiding lock-in:\nA neutral orchestration layer lets teams plug in different AI models or services as needed, without being tied to one vendor’s ecosystem. This mitigates the fear of having to rebuild everything if you switch providers. As\none engineer advocated\n, the goal is for end users\n“not have to worry about vendor lock-in… ensuring AI systems work seamlessly across platforms rather than trapping users within a single vendor’s ecosystem.”\nBy speaking a “common language” to multiple AI backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source models, etc.), an orchestration layer ensures you can always choose the best tool for the job and pivot when technology or pricing changes.\nMulti-agent coordination and specialization:\nAn orchestration platform can manage a\nteam of agents\n, each specialized for a subtask, and coordinate their interactions deterministically. This reduces complexity for the practitioner—the orchestration layer can handle task routing, state management, and error recovery across agents. Instead of one monolithic agent attempting everything (and often failing unpredictably), you can have simpler agents focused on specific roles, with the orchestration layer linking them. Such a setup can also include rule-based automation or traditional software components for tasks that don’t require AI, ensuring that AI is only used where it adds value. The result is a more\nrobust system\nwhere if one component fails or produces uncertain output, the orchestration platform can catch it (e.g. via validations, retries, or fallbacks).\nCost optimization and resource flexibility:\nA vendor-agnostic platform can dynamically choose between different models or routes to minimize cost while meeting performance needs. For example, it might use a cheaper local model for simple queries and call a more expensive API only for complex cases—transparently to the end user. It can also batch requests, cache results, or adjust the frequency of agent runs.\nOne team reported\ndoing this manually (adding caching and using a cheaper model for certain tasks); an intelligent orchestration platform could handle such optimizations automatically. Additionally, by not being tied to one vendor, organizations can take advantage of pricing competition—switching to a more cost-effective service if one raises prices. This\nflexibility\nimproves ROI\n, since the orchestration ensures you’re using resources in the most efficient way (the\n“best and cheapest”\nmodel for each job, as users desire).\nRead \"The Definitive Guide to Agentic Orchestration\".\nIn summary, a proven and trustworthy\nagentic orchestration layer\ndirectly addresses many pain points:\nIt delivers controlled agency by improving agent reliability without compromising autonomy or utility\nBlends AI with humans and robots for better outcomes\nAbstracts multi-agent complexity into a manageable framework\nAvoids single-vendor limitations\nProvides the governance needed for enterprise-scale deployment\nBy learning from real-world struggles—repeatability issues, integration headaches, security fears, cost overruns—such a solution can empower practitioners to harness AI agents with far less friction and risk.

They are getting real results with agentic automation. The most forward-thinking enterprises are orchestrating AI agents, deterministic robots, and people into impactful, end-to-end workflows. At our recent Agentic AI Summit, we showcased how UiPath customers are building autonomous enterprise agents to drive transformational value and change the way we work.\nOne of the best examples came from Emily Krohne, Enterprise Automation Principal at WEX, the global payments company. After leading a three-year transformation with UiPath, Emily is driving an agentic automation program to enhance sales team preparation and streamline document processing. Check out my full interview as part of the Agentic AI Summit Keynote\nhere\n.\nIn this recap, I’ll share the most compelling stories and announcements from the UiPath Agentic AI Summit:\nUiPath Agent Builder: how to build, test, and deploy specialized enterprise agents\nEnterprises want to use AI agents but need to ensure accurate, consistent, and trustworthy results. Yet, they lack the tools to build, test, and deploy these agents alongside robots and people. Organizations seek to create AI agents and orchestrate their activity in complex workflows—with robots for routine, deterministic tasks and people for critical decisions. They also require ways to customize, inspect, and refine agent behavior to increase their accuracy over time.\nAt the Summit, we showed how UiPath helps customers develop specialized enterprise agents. UiPath Senior Product Manager Zach Eslami announced the April 30 global launch of\nUiPath Agent Builder\n. Agent Builder is a unified tool for building, testing, and deploying AI agents. It supports both pro-code and low-code users, offering simple natural language agent creation, prebuilt templates, memory and business context, as well as evaluation tools. Agent Builder creates specialized AI agents that work seamlessly across systems and ecosystems in governed, orchestrated workflows.\nLet’s see Agent Builder in action! Imagine you’re a financial services provider seeking to build an AI agent for your loan origination and approval process. Agent Builder allows you to create the agent by selecting a model, providing instructions in the form of prompts, and giving the agent a set of useful tools. It also makes it easy to give your agents relevant business context and add escalation paths to ensure your team is kept in the loop.\nAt a recent agentic hackathon, WEX developers used Agent Builder, UiPath Autopilot™, and our agentic orchestration capabilities to address several business challenges. In code management, WEX built a new agent, GitHub Manager, which is estimated to save 6,000 work hours annually. For claims processing, a claims review agent now cuts review time from hours to mere seconds. Lastly, a multi-agent fraud detection system helps WEX streamline investigations, making their fraud prevention process more proactive and adaptable.\nSign up for the UiPath Insider Program\nto be the first to try Agent Builder.\nAgentic orchestration: enabling multi-agent collaboration with robots and people\nBusinesses are increasingly adopting AI and automation tools, including AI agents, to optimize processes. However, the growing complexity of business operations—driven by a mix of siloed capabilities licensed from multiple vendors—creates challenges in process management, security, and governance. Agentic orchestration addresses this by seamlessly integrating agentic, robotic, and human-centric workflows with the systems and applications necessary for process execution. It transforms disconnected automated tasks into cohesive, end-to-end processes, enabling businesses to scale AI effectively while maintaining visibility and control.\nThe UiPath Platform™ is an agentic orchestration leader; at the Summit, our Vice President of Product Management Arun Mehta demonstrated this with the reveal of\nUiPath Maestro\n. Now in public preview, Maestro empowers customers to orchestrate work with an ecosystem-agnostic approach. That means that, irrespective of which platform the agents or automations were built on, or which AI models they are using, every business can now model, operate, and optimize its processes with a well-tuned symphony involving multiple agents and robots—as well as people always in the loop as the leaders, coordinators, and ultimate decision makers.\nIn the example below, Maestro orchestrates an end-to-end invoice process. See how Maestro coordinates the entire workflow, seamlessly handing off work between robots, people, and a purchase order matching agent to rapidly fulfill the request:\nOur customers are eager to run cross-ecosystem agentic automations with Maestro. Hannes Hudd, Manager, Business Process Automation Development at Wärtsilä, a global manufacturer of marine and energy solutions, said:\nAgentic orchestration is where business processes and flows come together with people, automation, and AI. The product's capabilities and the rapid development pace achieved by UiPath are truly impressive! The future vision for agentic orchestration is exceptionally promising, and we are excited to see its full potential realized.\nHannes Hudd, Manager, Business Process Automation Development at Wärtsilä\nUiPath Maestro is now\navailable for all UiPath Automation Cloud™ customers to try\nahead of its April 30 release. If you are not already a customer, you can\ntry Automation Cloud for free\n—with UiPath Maestro included.\nIXP: transform complex documents into actionable data at speed and scale\nTechnology analyst firm\nIDC\nhas reported that 90% of data generated in an enterprise is unstructured—most often locked away in complex documents ranging from patient notes to purchase orders. This valuable context is essential for AI agents to perform at the required level of autonomy, and enterprises will need to leverage advanced intelligent document processing (IDP) capabilities to unlock this data and make it actionable.\nMark Geene, UiPath SVP & General Manager of AI Products, showed how we are supporting businesses and AI agents with our best-in-class IDP solution. He announced the April release of our new product,\nUiPath IXP (Intelligent Xtraction and Processing)\n. IXP is a major leap for UiPath IDP, leveraging AI advances that enable rapid multimodal data extraction. It provides an intuitive, prompt-based experience that eliminates the need for extensive data labeling, cutting time to production. UiPath IXP extracts the information you need from all document types, empowering you to automate more of your existing processes.\nAutomation engineers at WEX are already using UiPath IXP to build, test, and deploy extraction models at scale.\nImporting our documents to train was easy, and the predictive labeling saves us a lot of time with training. We specifically leaned into this solution because of its strong capability to recognize document types with minimal effort.\nTimothy Corbett, Senior Automation Engineer at WEX\nSee how UiPath IXP drives end-to-end automation in the most complex workflows.\nSign up for the private preview now\n.\nAgentic testing: the software testing revolution powered by UiPath Test Cloud\nSoftware development moves fast, but manual testing slows it down. Fortunately,\nagentic testing\nhas now made it faster than ever. Equipped with AI agents, software testing teams can engage in agentic testing for supercharged productivity across the testing lifecycle. Agents are automating complex testing tasks, augmenting testers to extend, simplify, and speed up their work.\nTo accelerate this revolution, Ingo Philipp, UiPath Senior Director of Product Management, revealed\nUiPath Test Cloud\n—the next evolution of UiPath Test Suite. UiPath Test Cloud provides a complete agentic testing platform, with resilient end-to-end test automation for modern enterprise applications, production-grade architecture and governance, and an interface catering to the needs of application testers. Users can also augment their testing with powerful agents like UiPath Autopilot™ for Testers and specialized agents built with Agent Builder. With these capabilities, teams can accelerate time to value while delivering high-quality software.\nLeading enterprises have already achieved great value with UiPath agentic testing. Cisco has used Autopilot for Testers to halve manual testing efforts, leading to over $1 million in projected annual savings. Financial services company State Street uses UiPath to automate the end-to-end testing of their Alpha Platform, resulting in significant time savings as compared to manual testing.\nYou can hear more about State Street’s agentic testing vision from Brandon McCormick, State Street Global Practice Area Lead for Testing, System Performance, and Global Batch Cycle:\nSign up for UiPath Test Cloud\nto see how agentic testing can multiply your team’s productivity.\nTurning agentic potential into business transformation\nUiPath Agentic AI Summit captured some of the early successes our customers and partners achieved with agentic automation. But we’re just getting started.\nThe value of agentic AI won’t be achieved with isolated AI agents. Agentic automation requires orchestration, dynamic AI, robotic precision, and human expertise to drive consistent, reliable, and transformative outcomes. The UiPath Platform gives customers the enterprise tools, agentic capabilities, and controlled agency to be leaders in this new agentic and robotic era.\nWatch the UiPath Agentic AI Summit on demand to see our latest agentic capabilities in action, and\njoin our Insider Portal\nto be among the first to try them out!\nTopics:\nAgentic\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nEvents\nAutomation Cloud\nIntelligent document processing\nAgentic orchestration\nGraham\nSheldon\nChief Product Officer\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nAI\nSeptember 8, 2025\nUiPath named a Leader in the Gartner First-Ever Magic Quadrant for Intelligent Document Processing\nAI\nAugust 6, 2025\nWhy AI agents need intelligent document processing\nAI\nJuly 28, 2025\nAn OS for the enterprise: AI that orchestrates everything\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSubscribe\nGet articles from automation experts in your inbox\nSign up today and we'll email you the newest articles every week.\nThank you for subscribing!\nThank you for subscribing!

However, despite significant investments in generative and conversational AI, contact centers continue to struggle with fragmented processes and manual back-office tasks.\nThese investments have failed to address the root of the problem: disconnected systems requiring high-touch workflows that slow resolution time. The result? Inflated service costs and degraded customer satisfaction (CSAT).\nFortunately, new AI-enabled approaches to customer service are turning the tide. Indeed,\nGartner predicts\nthat agentic AI will autonomously resolve 80% of common customer service issues by 2029, boosting service efficiency and satisfaction.\nIn this blog, I’ll explain how contact center leaders can use\nagentic AI\nto tackle fragmented processes and streamline work across teams and technologies.\nExplore further\n: i\nn addition to this blog post, we've got everything from e-books to demos showcasing how agentic automation helps improve customer service.\nEmail: the channel contact centers love to hate\nWhile customer support is fragmented across numerous channels, from interactive voice response (IVR) to chat, email remains the channel of choice for customers.\nOver half (55%) of consumers\nprefer to communicate via email. However, email has always been a challenge for the contact center, and servicing its demand has proven unscalable. Increasingly unsustainable staffing levels have produced little success, with the\naverage email response time for enterprises\nnow standing at 12 hours.\nEarly adopters have attempted to address this challenge with AI, but their efforts have been stymied by a lack of integration. The email management process is fragmented across numerous tools and touchpoints, impacting resolution times and CSAT. Email management is dependent on manual tasks that bog down service reps in repetitive work: triaging tickets, looking for data, and crafting manual replies. Every manual step in the email management process increases the risk of errors and delays, undermining customer relationships.\nCustomer email resolution presents challenges of scale, fragmentation, and a heavy reliance on inefficient manual work. However, thanks to recent advances in AI, email is now ripe for end-to-end automation.\nAgentic automation: enhance service efficiency and satisfaction\nNew to agentic automation? This quick video is a great place to start.\nAI agents have become a crucial component in the contact center alongside conversational and generative AI technologies. These are goal-driven entities capable of planning, adapting, and executing on behalf of users. Within the contact center, they are orchestrated alongside automation robots and people to perform work—navigating systems, making decisions, and executing tasks in real time.\nAI agents excel at resolving first and second-tier email inquiries, whether it’s routine account updates or policy-dependent refund requests. They can also automate the opening steps of more complex issues—saving time for both customers and service reps.\nYet, proper integration and coordination are critical. Today, many\ncontact centers are investing in AI and automation\ncapabilities—but they often exist in silos: robots handle routine clicks, AI tools parse documents, and people fill in the gaps. An orchestration layer is needed to ensure these capabilities, including AI agents, are properly integrated.\nAn\nagentic orchestration solution\ncontinuously coordinates tasks across channels and systems so that AI agents work in tandem with robots, tools, and customer service representatives. Whether it’s resolving a billing issue, updating a CRM, or generating a follow-up email, agentic orchestration ensures the right work happens at the right moment.\nDriving agentic email automation\nAgentic automation\nenables enterprises to optimize contact center operations, including the elimination of repetitive email work. Indeed, AI agents—leveraging tools and working alongside robots and customer service representatives—can overhaul the entire email support process.\nUiPath provides an agentic solution to automate customer email resolution end to end. Through the combined use of multiple tools, including\nUiPath IXP\n(Intelligent Xtraction & Processing), emails are automatically classified, routed, or responded to by a combination of AI agents and robots using dynamic templates and data sources. All of these interactions are seamlessly coordinated by\nUiPath Maestro\n™, our agentic orchestration capability.\nIn the UiPath solution, customer service reps still intervene where there's greater uncertainty in the process and to handle exceptions. Yet, the bulk of email processing is performed upstream by AI agents and robots—accelerating responses and improving accuracy. As a result, routine inquiries are automatically processed and resolved, freeing teams to focus on more complex customer needs, increasing organizational productivity, and job satisfaction.\nTo understand the impact of agentic automation and orchestration, let’s consider a real-world example. The contact center of a leading manufacturer was struggling to process 500,000 emails annually from customers querying their invoices. The team was hitting a glass ceiling with existing automations due to low accuracy in request classification (55%-65%). In addition, between 20-25% of invoices didn't have the proper data extracted, requiring human review.\nThis changed when the team created an invoice processing agent in under two days using\nUiPath Agent Builder\n. The agent doubled the accuracy in sample data and improved the accuracy of extracted invoices by 10% in a single region pilot. A Microsoft Copilot Studio agent demonstrated early improvements in categorization, while also being evaluated for dispute resolution. The integrated process enabled end-to-end touchless processing, contributing to 18,000 hours saved annually and a 500% incremental ROI on an already automated process.\nThe benefits of agentic email management\nIntelligent email management, enabled by agentic automation and orchestration, improves operational and customer outcomes in four key areas:\n1. Increase efficiency\nOptimize email workflows\n: streamline email workflows by automating tasks such as retrieving data, updating records, and scheduling follow-ups\nAutomate issue resolution\n: automatically create support tickets from customer emails and track their progress, ensuring no inquiries are missed\nOptimize resource allocation\n: route emails to the appropriate departments based on issue type and priority\n2. Enhance customer experience\nPersonalization\n: access real-time suggestions and information from knowledge bases and CRM systems to create personalized cross-sell and up-sell promotions\nDynamic experiences\n: rather than relying on static scripts or limited data snapshots, AI agents dynamically adjust their suggestions based on evolving customer needs and behavior\n3. Accelerate categorization and prioritization\nCategorization\n: analyze incoming emails and categorize them based on topic, urgency, and complexity, allowing customer service reps to focus on the most critical issues\nPrioritization\n: rapidly process high-value opportunities or urgent issues like sales leads and customer complaints for rapid resolution\n4. Drive customer service improvement\nDemand reduction\n: with process intelligence and communications mining, you can identify and address the root causes of customer contact, helping to reduce demand on overstretched teams and communications channels\nContent creation\n: identify recurring queries and create automated templates for common requests, saving time and effort\nBuilding the agentic contact center\nMany contact centers have already deployed AI and automation, but as disparate point solutions—isolated capabilities solving isolated problems.\nAgentic automation and orchestration unify these efforts. They create autonomous, observable, end-to-end processes that operate across systems, teams, and tools. This enables contact centers to automate complex service tasks (like email resolution) with consistency, visibility, and adaptability, without the need to replace core systems.\nFor contact center leaders, the benefits are immediate and strategic: faster case resolution, fewer escalations, and more empowered service reps. AI agents can triage, route, and resolve a high volume of queries autonomously, while orchestration ensures seamless handoffs between systems and people. All of which results in enhanced service quality and operational efficiency alike.\nAs customer expectations rise and service complexity grows, organizations that embrace AI agents and orchestration will deliver faster, more proactive and scalable support—turning the contact center into a strategic differentiator.\nDive deeper into how UiPath agentic automation supercharges your contact center\n, reduces demand, and augments service rep productivity.\nTopics:\nContact Center\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nAgentic\nScott\nDresser\nGrowth Sales, Contact Center Expert\n,\nUiPath\nRelated articles\nIndustry Solutions\nMay 21, 2025\nStill running AI agents and RPA in silos in financial services?

They never ask for time off, donât forget deadlines, and donât mind running tasks at midnight. No reminders, no second opinionsâAI agents just move. This isnât about some distant future. Digital agents are shifting data, approving changes, and triggering actions in real time right now, across APIs and business boundaries, without human oversight.\nWelcome to the âagentic era,â defined by composable, self-replicating machine actors that work at machine speed, moving seamlessly, tirelessly, and often invisibly.\nWhich brings us to what matters: When these agents take action, can you show, clearly and quickly, that they followed your rulesâand only your rules? Or are you hoping your policies are holding, while everything runs out of sight?\nThe question confronting organizations is fundamental:\nCan you demandâand demonstrateâtrust, not just hope, as you scale these new operational realities?\nTrust Demands Proof at Machine Speed\nFor years, organizations leaned on contracts, audits, and a string of approvals to keep things in check. That workedâsort ofâwhen humans moved the pieces, at human pace. Now, agents can rewrite code and trigger payments at 2 a.m., and the old playbook falls apart. It's not just a speed issue.\nThe gap is proof.\nAaron Fulkerson put it plainly at the Confidential Computing Summit\n:\n\"Agents behave with human-like capabilities, but operate at machine speed. Policy without proof is not trustâit's hope.\"\nJust look at the numbers. At\nAnthropic\n, agents like Claude are now generating 70% of the company's code. By the end of this year, that number is expected to hit 95%. One vulnerable agent, moving at this pace, can trigger a chain reactionâharm ripples out globally, not locally, and there's no slowing things down after the fact.\nIt's not just one company.\nCrewAI\nprocesses 60 million agents every month, and this usage is doubling monthly.\nMicrosoft\nis now protecting more than a billion credit card transactions every year, and 60 billion licensing transactions every monthâall secured in environments that demand policy as code, not just policy on paper.\nWhen machines operate at this volume and velocity, indirect trust falls apart. The only thing that stands up is proofâimmediate, concrete, and always available when you need it.\nThe End of Static Rules in a Dynamic World\nIt used to be that human speed was a built-in safety net. Mistakes, breaches, approvalsâthey happened in slow motion, with people stepping in to review or push back. Now, agents are operating in real time, shuffling data, executing transactions, and compiling code behind the scenes. Scale isn't the only difference; it's the absence of friction.\nLook at the direction set by names like Microsoft, CrewAI, and Anthropic. They arenât just ramping up volumeâtheyâre prioritizing transparency, automation, and proof at the core of every system. The takeaway from their approach isnât complicated: trust has to be woven into every step, not something you try to reconstruct after the fact. If your systems leave you squinting at yesterdayâs logs, youâre already behind.\nIn this new pace, \"trust by promise\" is dead weight. You can't get by on goodwill or after-the-fact paperwork. The bar has moved: policies must be enforced live, every time, by the system itselfâand every action needs to leave a trail you can show.\nIf your policy isn't coded into the workflow, you're not protecting anything; you're hoping for the best and preparing for a mess.\nThis scale and automation make âtrust by promiseâ obsolete. The new baseline:\ncontinuous, verifiable, and runtime enforcement\nâarchitected policy-as-code, not after-the-fact paperwork.\nScaling Verifiable Trust: Microsoftâs 100,000+ VM Deployment\nWhen you move at agent speed, trust can't be handled with a checklist. Microsoftâs journey makes that clear. They didnât just patch the old systems and call it doneâthey built trust into the foundation.\nIn\nOPAQUEâS Confidential Computing Summit 2025\n, we learned that over 100,000 confidential virtual machines now run across 70+ regions. Payment systems that handle more than a billion credit card transactions every year have shifted to the public cloud, secured by hardware-backed trusted execution environments. Licensing services moved from isolated back rooms to the cloud as well, with every transaction and policy transparent and auditable.\nHere's what stands out: manual checks donât scale. At this level, the only way to stay ahead is full automationâprogrammatic attestation, cryptographic proof, and transparency built into every step of the stack. âLift and shiftâ gets you to the cloud, but the real gains come when trust is layered directly into runtime and workflows, not as an afterthought.\nFour Essential Components of Agentic Trust\nAt this yearâs Confidential Computing Summit, we heard directly from leaders at Google, AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, and the fastest-moving startups in AI and cloud. The message was consistentâand grounded in real deployments, not wishful thinking. To actually operate at agent speed and scale, you need hard evidence, not just institutional trust.\nFirst: behavioral attestation.\nEvery action, every check, every line of code an agent runs must leave a record you can actually verifyâlater or instantly.\nSecond: identity thatâs not static or general.\nEvery agent and workload needs a unique, attributable signature, no matter where it roams or who touches it.\nThird: real-time, machine-driven enforcement.\nIf something strays from policy, it gets blocked. And thereâs proof, right away, not after an audit weeks later.\nFourth: transparency and interoperability by design.\nStandards need to be open, APIs need to be shared, and trust needs to be composable and inspectable from the outside.\nAs NVIDIAâs VP of Software Product Security, Architecture and Research at NVIDIA, Daniel Roher, told the Summitâs audience, âNo one company can deliver the full ecosystem. This requires collaboration to scale trust, not just compute.â\nPractical Steps for Proof-Based Operations\nItâs one thing to talk about proof. Making it realâmaking it routineâis where teams win or lose. At our Summit, the best examples all had the same pattern: trust is built in, not bolted on after the fact.\nStart with security as the default, not an add-on.\nCrewAIâs enterprise customersâincluding big banks, government, and Fortune 500 companiesâinsist that every new agent or feature is auditable and confidential from the start.\nDonât rely on manual enforcement.\nProgrammatic governance, procurement, and CI/CD pipelines do the heavy lifting, blocking anything that canât produce cryptographic proof. If the system canât show its work, it doesnât go live.\nSkills matter, too.\nCross-functional engineers, risk managers, and product leads are now expected to speak the same language when it comes to trust and proof, not pass the buck across silos.\nDemand proof from your vendors. As Graham Mudd, Senior Vice President, Product Management at Mozilla, stated at the Confidential Computing Summit 2025: large platforms only agree to share (or even move) data when thereâs strong attestation and code transparency backing it up.\nAnd measure the impact.\nCrewAIâs clients are seeing up to 94% workflow efficiency gains from agentic automation. But hereâs the catch: only 13% of enterprises actually get real ROI from AI. The difference? Proof isnât an afterthoughtâitâs the backbone.\nShared Standards for Cross-Boundary Trust\nNo single company gets to define trust for everyone else. That message rang out from every major speakerâMicrosoft, Google, AMD, Intel, NVIDIAâall calling for open APIs, shared attestation, and industry-wide transparency standards.\nThe pattern is clear: distributed systems mean distributed responsibility. AMDâs Trusted I/O is making it possible to track silicon provenance across complex supply chains. Swift is running anti-money-laundering checks across multiple banks, analyzing sensitive transactions in real time without leaking proprietary data. Whether itâs finance or hardware, the only way to scale trust is to share the rules, not keep them locked up.\nMike Bursell, Executive Director at Confidential Computing Consortium, shared at the Summit: âMulti-stakeholder, multi-step processes are where confidential computing adds unique value. Mutually distrusting parties can trust each other and thereby create value.â When nobody owns the whole stack, proving trust becomes everyoneâs jobâand the ecosystem rises or falls together.\nAre You Ready? The Trust and Infrastructure Readiness Challenge\nNow comes the uncomfortable audit. Itâs not enough to read the headlines or deploy a new tool. Run this checklist:\nAre TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) and remote attestation built into your stackâboth cloud and on-prem?\nDo your policies actually run as code, enforced at machine speed, or are they just words in a document?\nCan any credible third party verify your complianceâinstantly, and with cryptographic proof?\nIs your ecosystem built on open, composable standards, or are you boxed in by vendor promises you canât see or check?\nAre your engineering, risk, and business teams âtrust fluent,â or still working in and hoping the controls will catch problems before you do?\nIf you canât answer positively across these dimensions, youâre not just behindâyouâre exposed. Scaling trust is as much a cultural and organizational challenge as it is technical. The winners arenât those who claim to value trust, but those who can prove it, under scrutiny, at speed.\nTomorrow's Threat Today: Quantum Computing and Agent Trust\nWhile we're building agent infrastructure for now, quantum computing is already challenging the foundations underneath. The cryptography securing today's agentsâfrom identity to attestationâwasn't built to withstand quantum attacks. And the timeline isn't decades away; it's approaching faster than most security roadmaps account for.\nGoogle's recent quantum advances solved problems in minutes that would take classical computers years. Major browsers and cloud providers aren't waiting: Chrome, Google Cloud, and core libraries like BoringSSL are already deploying post-quantum cryptography in production environments.\nThis creates an urgent reality check for agent deployments:\nYour current stack has a built-in expiration date.\nThe RSA and ECC algorithms securing your agent identities and attestation chains will become vulnerable. An agent that's trusted today could become an entry point tomorrow.\nRegulators are already asking hard questions.\nThe EU AI Act and financial sector frameworks now specifically require quantum resilience planning. Auditors aren't just asking if you use agentsâthey're asking for proof your infrastructure can adapt when cryptography changes.\nThe organizations building right will win twice.\nTeams that implement cryptographic agility nowâthe ability to swap algorithms without rebuilding systemsâgain both security and speed. When standards shift, they'll migrate in days, not quarters.\nThe solution lies in the same principles we've covered throughout: verifiable, programmatic trust that's built for change. Your agent infrastructure needs:\nCryptographic abstraction layers in your CI/CD pipelines\nClear inventory of every dependency's quantum readiness\nRuntime verification that works across algorithm changes\nVendor commitments with actual technical evidence\nThose who treat quantum readiness as a future problem will find themselves rebuilding agent infrastructure under pressureâwith potentially compromised systems. Those who build cryptographic agility into today's deployments will adapt seamlessly when quantum threats materialize.\nIn the agentic era, verifiable trust isn't just about today's risks; it's about building systems resilient enough to survive fundamental changes in what \"secure\" means. The future belongs to those who can prove their trustworthiness even as the rules of proof evolve.\nReal Trust Wins the Agentic Era\nRegulators and attackers are pushing expectations higherâfast. The organizations that get ahead are the ones who turn verifiable trust into an operating principle, not just a slogan, and who can back it up at scale.\nThe numbers prove it:\n100,000+ confidential VMs now in production at Microsoft\nOver 1 billion credit card transactions protected every year\nCrewAIâs clients reporting 94% efficiency gains\nOnly 13% of enterprises realizing real ROI from AI\nThe era of trust-by-assertion is over. Trust-by-proof isnât theoryâitâs here, and itâs the dividing line between those who can scale with confidence and those left reacting to every new risk.\nReady to see where you stand? Start with a serious readiness assessment, not another round of hopeful âbest practices.â The future belongs to those who demand trust they can actually demonstrate.\nWant to see how OPAQUE can help you operationalize trust from the ground up?\nRequest a demo\nand put your policies to the testâin real environments.\nVisit\nConfidential Computing Summit 2025\nfor exclusive resources, expert insights, and tools from the premier AI infrastructure event of the year to move from pilot to real results.\nRelated Content\nShowing\n28\nGuardRail OSS, open source project, provides guardrails for responsible AI development\nThis is some text inside of a div block.\nGENERAL\nRead More\nAugust 13, 2025\nBlog\nFuture-Ready Agent Infrastructure: Strengthening Today's Operations Against Tomorrow's Threats\nAugust 13, 2025\nBlog\nRead More\nAugust 13, 2025\nBlog\nFrom Proof of Concept to Proof of Value: The 5 Levels of Confidential AI Readiness\nAugust 13, 2025\nBlog\nRead More\nHave a question about OPAQUEâs Confidential Computing Platform or want to see a live demo?\nReach out here\nCOMPANY\nHome\nAbout\nResources\nCareers\nContact\nSOLUTIONS\nInsurance\nFinance\nHigh-Tech\nContact\n[email protected]\nLinkedIn\nX (Formerly Twitter)\nÂ© 2024 OPAQUE Systems, Inc.

But this promise brings a hard question:\nHow do you guarantee data privacy when sensitive enterprise information flows into and through an LLM?\nDespite encryption at rest, network segmentation, or even prompt filtering, traditional AI architectures often fail to provide\nend-to-end privacy assurance\n. Data is decrypted for processing. LLMs operate in exposed environments. Thereâs little visibilityâlet alone cryptographic proofâof how data is used.\nAt Opaque, we believe privacy and AI donât have to be at odds. In fact, weâve built the Confidential AI Platform to make sure they work hand-in-hand. This post explores the\nprivacy lifecycle of enterprise data in LLM workflows\n, and how Opaque delivers verifiable protections\nbefore\n,\nduring\n, and\nafter\neach interaction.\nBefore: Verifying Trust Before Any Data Moves\nMost RAG architectures fail before a single token is generated.\nWhy? Because the pipeline assumes trust in the LLM provider, the data connection, and the runtime environmentâwithout cryptographic verification.\nWith Opaque, we flip the model:\nNo data is exposed until trust is proven\n.\nHardware-rooted attestation\nensures the LLM environment is running inside a confidential enclave, on trusted CPUs or GPUs (e.g., Intel SGX or NVIDIA H100s with HBI).\nPolicy validation\nensures the LLM and its orchestration pipeline (e.g., agents, plugins, connectors) are only allowed to execute if approved governance policies are in place.\nEncrypted RAG source binding\nmeans even the knowledge base (vector store or database) stays encrypted until itâs read inside an enclave that passes attestation.\nThis pre-flight security posture is what distinguishes Confidential AI. Itâs not just âencrypted at restââitâs\nprovably isolated and controlled before data ever leaves its vault.\nDuring: Enforcing Policy Through the Entire LLM Workflow\nOnce a prompt hits the LLM, the real complexity begins: multiple agents may be invoked, tools called, RAG queries run, and user data processedâall potentially in ways that violate privacy rules or compliance boundaries.\nOpaqueâs Confidential AI Platform enforces\ncontinuous, fine-grained policy controls\n:\nRAG data decryption only inside enclaves\n, with runtime enforcement of access rules: e.g., âHR data must not be accessed by customer support agents.â\nGovernance on prompt inputs and tool outputs\n: define redaction, anonymization, or filtering rules on-the-fly, without trusting the LLM itself to behave.\nAgent interaction tracing\nensures every action (tool call, function chain, memory access) is authorized by the approved data-use policy.\nBecause everything runs within a secure, attested enclave, even insider threats or rogue code canât exfiltrate data or break the chain of custody.\nAfter: Proving What Happened with Cryptographic Audit Trails\nPrivacy doesnât end with a response. Organizations need to\nprove\nthat sensitive data was protected and used responsiblyâespecially in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and government.\nOpaque delivers\npost-interaction accountability\n:\nTamper-proof audit logs\nsigned by the enclaveâs hardware root of trust.\nEnd-to-end cryptographic evidence\nshowing what data was accessed, how it was used, and which agents or models handled it.\nPolicy verification results\nproving that the entire LLM pipeline acted in accordance with declared governance policies.\nThis after-the-fact auditability isnât just helpfulâitâs\nrequired\nfor modern data compliance frameworks like ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA.\nThe Confidential Advantage for Enterprise AI\nOpaqueâs Confidential AI Platform uniquely addresses the full data privacy lifecycle across LLM interactions:\nConclusion\nRAG-powered LLMs are reshaping enterprise productivity. But with that power comes responsibilityâespecially when proprietary data, customer information, or regulated content is involved.\nOpaque delivers\na secure, end-to-end platform for AI workflows\nthat protects sensitive data\nbefore\n,\nduring\n, and\nafter\nevery LLM interaction. Confidential computing isnât an add-onâitâs the foundation.\nIf youâre building private LLMs or want to unlock RAG without compromising data privacy,\ntalk to us\nabout deploying on the Opaque Confidential AI Platform.\nâ\nRelated Content\nShowing\n28\nGuardRail OSS, open source project, provides guardrails for responsible AI development\nThis is some text inside of a div block.\nGENERAL\nRead More\nNo items found.\nHave a question about OPAQUEâs Confidential Computing Platform or want to see a live demo?\nReach out here\nCOMPANY\nHome\nAbout\nResources\nCareers\nContact\nSOLUTIONS\nInsurance\nFinance\nHigh-Tech\nContact\n[email protected]\nLinkedIn\nX (Formerly Twitter)\nÂ© 2024 OPAQUE Systems, Inc.

But real value? Itâs elusive. In many organizations, âAI strategyâ starts and stops with proof-of-concept slides, not business outcomes. Teams invest heavily, but often finish the quarter with a flashy demo, a handful of âAI-poweredâ tools in production, and a lingering sense that somethingâs missing.\nAccording to\nTeresa Tung, Senior Managing Director at Accenture\n, presenting at the\nConfidential Computing Summit 2025\n, their deep dive into 2,000+ generative AI projects reveals that only\n13% of enterprises actually see ROI from AI investments\n. The other 87%? Stuck in endless pilots and dead-end deploymentsâa rut with real consequences for risk, cost, and competitive edge.\nHow do you break out? It requires more than bigger budgets. You need to be brutally honest about where you areâand what it takes to move from excitement to evidence. Thatâs where the Confidential AI Maturity Framework comes in. Think of it as your roadmap out of the âpilot purgatoryâ and into sustainable, cross-functional, verifiable AI value.\nItâs built on lessons from Accenture, OPAQUE, and the Confidential Computing Summitâs most pragmatic leaders, all facing the same question: Are you ready for AI agents that act at machine speed, in production, with trust you can prove? If you want to scale AI with confidenceânot just hopeâyouâll need to know what stage youâre really at.\nThis guide breaks down the five stages of enterprise Confidential AI readiness, with diagnostic questions, hard-won lessons, and a clear path to move up the ladder. By the end, youâll be able to benchmark where you standâand, more importantly, what itâll take to join the 13% who are seeing impact.\nWhy Confidential AI Maturity Matters Now\nLet's talk about why Confidential AI maturity mattersâurgently.\nThe numbers provided by Teresa Tung,Â  Senior Managing Director at Accenture, at the Confidential Computing Summit tell a clear story:\n83% of leaders say they're excited about A\nI, but many projects hit a wall at \"progressing.\" That means lots of energy, not much to show for it, and a whole lot of fragmented efforts that never escape their silo.\nAI agents are already everywhere:\nCrewAI\nnow clocks 60 million agents a month, while Microsoft's got 100,000+ confidential VMs humming away. But these wins have exposed just how quickly old-school controls and ad hoc \"AI experiments\" reach their limit.\nAt this scale, it's easy to lose track of who owns the data, what rules are being followed, and whether anyone can prove a result wasn't just wishful thinking. It's the foundation for making AI reliable enough to bet the business on.\nIf you want AI to move past small wins and endless pilots, you need trusted data, cross-functional guardrails, and controls that run automatically, all the time. What separates the companies scaling real results is simple: they can show how things work, prove compliance on demand, and point to business impact. The teams that move beyond the âtrust usâ stage are the ones that get to scale with confidence.\nThe 5 Levels of Confidential AI Readiness\nClear benchmarks put your current approach in context and make progress measurable. Use this maturity model to identify where your organization stands today and what it takes to advance from experiments to enterprise-scale, trusted AI impact.\nSome companies overestimate where they land. If youâre not seeing measurable business impactâor canât show the receipts when askedâyouâre likely below Level 4. Letâs break down each stage.\n1. Experimenting (Sandbox Mode)\nMost organizations start here: small pilot projects, each run by different teams, rarely sharing knowledge or results. You might see a chatbot in HR, an AI-powered report in finance, or a data science âlabâ playing with models on the sideâeach one disconnected from the rest of the business.\nThereâs excitement, but little coordination or oversight. Data is messy or incomplete, and the teams involved are often working off their own playbooks. No surprise: what happens in the sandbox stays in the sandbox. These projects look good on slides but rarely deliver outcomes that anyone outside the originating team notices.\nTo move out of this stage, you need to find pockets of good data, start building bridges between teams, and get leadership interested in more than just the next demo. Progress starts when experiments connect to real business priorities and can be shared, repeated, or scaled beyond their original sandbox.\n2. Progressing (Isolated Use Cases)\nThis is when AI projects move beyond demos and finally hit production, but usually only in support domains like IT, HR, or finance. A department might automate invoice approvals or launch a customer chatbot; success is real, but these wins stay boxed inâisolated from the organizationâs core business.\nAt this stage, itâs common to see data and value stuck in silos. Governance is light or inconsistent, and each use case operates with its own playbook. Thereâs still no enterprise-wide policy, so every shiny new AI tool has to find its own path.\nTo advance, organizations need to connect these isolated winsâbuilding scalable governance, encouraging teams to share what works, and moving beyond one-off projects. Real progress starts when policy, data, and best practices spread throughout the business, setting up AI for broader, more reliable impact.\n3. Scaling (Multiple Domains)\nHere, you start to see AI projects popping up across several departmentsâmaybe supply chain is piloting forecasting models, marketing is running campaign optimizations, and operations is dabbling in workflow automation. Thereâs some early governance now, with guidelines just starting to appear.\nBut spreading fast comes with side effects: technical debt builds up, and each teamâs âquick winâ exposes fresh security, compliance, or privacy risks. The need for confidential computing grows more obvious as sensitive data and complex workloads cross boundaries. Companies in this stage feel the limits of ad hoc oversightâsmall issues get bigger, and the patchwork approach doesnât scale for long.\nTo move forward, youâll need to invest in clear value frameworks, tighten up governance, and make sure controls arenât just written down but enforced automatically. The teams that reach for robust, machine-driven policies (instead of heroic manual effort) are the first to make real, measurable ROI possible.\n4. Fast Follower (Strategic Bets)\nThis is where AI becomes integral to core business linesânot just the side projects or back office tasks. Teams adopt automated policy enforcement, confidential infrastructure, and enterprise-wide standards. Now, new AI initiatives plug into central pipelines for procurement, CI/CD (automation pipelines that turn code into deployable products), and compliance, and results can be measured and reported with far less manual overhead.\nStrategic cases drive expansion, not just curiosity or optimism. The organization is alignedâthe business, security, and IT are working from the same playbook, and AI starts moving at the pace of real business needs.\nHereâs how to stay in front: shorten the gap between experiment and ROI, and keep your people learning as fast as the tech evolves. This isnât the time to coast. Fast followers keep finding new efficiencies, updating automation as standards tighten, and making real-time adjustments as business priorities shift.\n5. Front Runner (Continuous Reinvention)\nThis is what it looks like when the training wheels come off. AI isnât just powering a handful of projectsâitâs at the core, driving how the business works, shifts, and grows. Agents and automation are everywhere: checking policy as they run, handling decisions on the fly, and pushing every part of the business to move faster.\nTeams here will question every routine, ditch legacy shortcuts, and keep pressure on themselves to deliver proof instead of promises. ROI isnât buried in spreadsheetsâitâs out in the open, as clear as the new standards others are trying to catch up to. This is where the industry comes to peek under the hood.\nTeams that lead at this level never sit still. Once something works, itâs on the chopping block for reinvention. If thereâs a sharper play or a better way to share results, theyâll find itâand back it up with proof. Comfortable is not an option here.\nFour Enablers and Lessons from the Summit\nThe Confidential Computing Summit 2025 made it clear what actually moves organizations up the maturity curve. These are the patterns and practices that kept showing up in the teams getting real results:\n1. Multidisciplinary leadership shows up in the trenches\nTransformation might start with the C-suite, but it lives or dies with cross-functional teams. Think of engineering, compliance, ops, and business leads working together on a live rolloutânot just swapping emails. One Summit example: a global bank brought legal and IT together from day one for every AI deployment, cutting bottlenecks later.\n2. Confidential AI becomes essential infrastructure\nThe Summit put it plainly: if your AI touches anything sensitive, \"good enough\" security doesnât cut it. The teams that are getting real results are locking down every part of the AI chainâmodels, data, training runs, inferenceânot just the easy parts like storage or transit. Confidential AI keeps your IP and customer data out of someone elseâs hands, even when the model is crunching it live.\nThe leading teams showed how to let models work on sensitive dataâcustomer records, contracts, source codeâwithout anyone being able to peek under the hood, whether theyâre inside your stack or outside. The leaders at the Summit were frank: the companies seeing ROI are the ones that treat confidential AI like plumbing, not a featureâalways on, often invisible, and absolutely non-negotiable when it matters.\n3. Automated governance is built-in, not an afterthought\nInstead of quarterly policy reviews, leaders bake controls into CI/CD pipelines and procurement so that anything not verifiable or attested never ships. At one panel, a SaaS company showed how they block unverified AI components automaticallyâno policy loopholes, no manual overrides.\n4. Continuous upskilling keeps everyone moving\nThe strongest teams invest in training across engineering, business, and compliance, even pulling in frontline contributors. For example, one enterprise created âAI fluency sprintsâ for every department, so nobody had to guess what good governance or secure agent infrastructure looked like on-the-job.\nThese enablers were highlighted again and again as the moves that unlocked real progress. The biggest takeaway? The companies that combine technical discipline with habits of transparency and collaboration outpace those still relying on hope and slide decks.\nHow to Stress-Test Your AI Readiness\nIf you want a clear read on your own maturity, start with the basics. Hereâs a checklist the best teams used to get honest about where they stoodâand what needed work:\nDo you have a solid, trustworthy data foundation for AI projects?\nAre your AI workflows governed and fully auditable, with policy enforcement that actually runs automatically?\nIs the executive team pushing for real cross-functional upskilling around AI, not just training for one group?\nDo your vendors and supply chain partners meet attestation (proof that a workload or process hasnât been tampered with) and transparency standards you can verify?\nCan you measure and report ROI on AIâand are those results driving ongoing improvement, not just collecting dust?\nIf you can answer yes to most of these, youâre ahead of the curve. If not, youâve got a clear starting point for what to fix next.\nReady to Benchmark Your Maturity?\nThe âagentic eraâ will reward organizations that turn experimentation into verifiable, scalable business progress. Use OPAQUEâs interactive assessment tool to benchmark your maturity and surface the enablers and gaps holding you back.\nThe lesson from confidential AIâs most successful leaders is clear:\nTransformation comes not from technical bravado or marketing hype, but from disciplined, evidence-backed progression through the stages of readiness. Most enterprises are still at Level 1 or 2âleaving massive value on the table. The time to move decisively is now.\nReady to assess your Confidential AI readiness?

In a recent demo, Jamie Aliperti, Director of Solutions at OPAQUE, showcased how our Confidential AI platform enables a secure, end-to-end agentic RAG pipeline, using an internal HR application as the use case.\nA Secure Agentic RAG Workflow, Built for Confidential Data\nThe demo walked through a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline designed to answer employee HR questions across a large organization. The key technical building blocks include:\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data Sources\n: HR documents and internal data remain encrypted throughout their lifecycle. Only the data owner retains the decryption key, and the data is never exposed â not even during model inference.\nHosted Models and Agents\n: The pipeline includes a hosted\nIBM Granite\nmodel and multiple specialized agents orchestrated in a secure chat workspace.

Cyberattacks once reserved for nation-statesâadvanced persistent threats, sophisticated zero-day exploits, and highly targeted phishing campaignsâare now within reach for any malicious actor equipped with generative AI. Today, attackers leverage large language models to rapidly identify vulnerabilities, crafting personalized spear-phishing emails indistinguishable from genuine communications, and launching zero-day exploits that propagate faster than security teams can react.Â\nBut there's a strategic blind spot most organizations miss: your AI's data exhaustâevery query log, interaction pattern, and model feedback loopâis now a goldmine for competitors and attackers. What was once harmless metadata is now strategic intelligence. AI makes it trivial to extract patterns from this exhaust, reverse-engineer your competitive advantages, and replicate your differentiated capabilities. If you're not protecting this data in use, you're training your competition.\nThe stakes arenât just higher; the game itself has changed. Organizations face a threat surface that isn't just larger, but more unpredictable. This new reality renders traditional security measures dangerously inadequate. Sensitive dataâcompensation details, contract terms, private reportsâonce protected by firewalls, data anonymization and masking techniques, and access controls, are now exposed to risks that didn't exist even a year ago. This creates an encryption gap that standard security protocols can't bridge.\nWhat's at stake isn't just data lossâit's the entire digital infrastructure. As AI systems become more integrated with the operations, they simultaneously become prime targets, exposing every connected system to unprecedented vulnerability. Itâs a business risk that grows with every rollout and new workflow.\nConfronting these unprecedented risks AI poses to privacy, security, and compliance requires rethinking data protection from the ground up. And thereâs only one way forward: close the encryption gap AI-driven attacks are designed to exploit at the exact moment AI puts sensitive data to work.\nConfidential Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is that shield. By enforcing privacy at the point of use to match AIâs capabilities in real time, Confidential RAG lets you move fast without letting control slip away. For companies betting on AIâs promise, itâs no longer a nice-to-have. Itâs now the entry ticket.\nâ\nThe Problem: Why Standard RAG Isnât Enough\nA question about sales commissions used to take days, passing from desk to desk. Now, AI handles it in seconds, pulling live numbers from HR, payroll, and sales.\nThat speed looks like progressâuntil the wrong details slip through.\nThe same process that gives you instant insight can also push confidential numbers, salaries, or contracts where they donât belong. All it takes is one wrong prompt or unchecked query for sensitive data to show up in the wrong report, dashboard, or inbox.\nStandard RAG was never built with these risks in mind. It connects internal sources, assembles context, and generates answers fast. But every query can sidestep the old controls. Firewalls and access lists might keep out outsiders, but theyâre not built to stop the wrong data from spreading inside your own walls.\nThe risks are very real. According to Accenture, half of enterprise AI models skip basic data protection. Outdated methods like anonymization or at-rest encryption cost more and still leave gaps. Fragmented systems make it worse: nearly half of organizations canât track data moving across teams, and most struggle with inconsistent data quality.\nBreaches are expensive. The\naverage cost is $4.45 million\n, and regulatory penalties keep climbingâover\nâ¬1.5 billion in GDPR fines\nlast year alone. But the hidden costs run deeper: a major financial services firm recently calculated that each month of delayed AI deployment due to security reviews costs them $2.3 million in lost productivity and competitive disadvantage. Another Fortune 500 manufacturer found that 73% of their AI projects were stuck in compliance review for over 6 months, representing $18 million in unrealized value.\nAI didnât just raise the stakes. It rewrote the rules. If you canât guarantee privacy when your agents run queries or generate reports, youâre betting your companyâs reputation on a system built for yesterdayâs risks.\nâ\nThe Missing Layer: What Makes Confidential RAG Different?\nProprietary data is now both your biggest asset and your biggest risk. As one of our high-tech CTOs said, âIf youâre going to do something valuable with AI, it starts and ends with your own data.â That data is more valuable than ever, because itâs the only true source of advantage. But itâs also easier to leak, mishandle, or lose.\nLegacy defensesâencryption at rest, audit logsâwere built for a world where data stayed in one place. Those controls fail when AI agents can pull, process, and share sensitive records in seconds.\nâConfidential RAG stands apart because it locks down proprietary data at the exact moment itâs used. Itâs not a luxury; itâs the new baseline for anyone who wants to win with AI. You keep your edge, without opening new risks,â a VP of Engineering at a Fortune 500 manufacturer told us.Â\nConfidential RAG sets strict controls at every point where data moves, verifying use, enforcing policy, and recording each step. Thatâs the difference: privacy isnât a checkpoint; itâs enforced in every action AI takes with your sensitive data.\nEvery query runs through a secure âvault,â so data stays protected while itâs being used, not just when itâs sitting still. This approach works seamlessly across your multi-cloud and hybrid infrastructureâwhether your data lives in AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-premise systems. No rip-and-replace required; Confidential RAG layers into your existing environment, protecting data wherever it resides and wherever it needs to flow.\nThe result: business leaders get answers, but sensitive information stays locked down. No accidental exposures. No shadow queries. No reputational damage from one bad prompt.\nAccentureâs latest research supports this. Companies relying on outdated methods spend more, protect less, and face growing audit burdens. Confidential RAG plugs the gapâin real time, every time.\nIf you want to win with proprietary data, you need a system that keeps it confidential at the very moment AI puts it to use. Otherwise, youâre just waiting for the breach.\nâ\nHow Confidential RAG Works: Inside a Confidential Pipeline\nConfidential RAG changes how organizations use and protect proprietary data in real time. Traditional controls only react after the fact; confidential RAG enforces guardrails at every stage of the AI workflow.Â\nimage caption here (optional)\nYou know whoâs accessing your data before anything moves. Each prompt is governed as it happens, not just reviewed months later. When the workflow completes, nothing escapes noticeâevery access and action is recorded in a tamper-proof log.\nThis approach gives you real guarantees: control before, during, and after data is used. Privacy and security are no longer single checkpointsâtheyâre embedded in every prompt, every query, every answer.\nThatâs where OPAQUE steps in. OPAQUE delivers these guarantees with confidential RAGâlocking down sensitive information at every phase, so you get answers without giving up control.\nConfidential RAG closes every window of risk. It enforces privacy at the very point AI creates valueâwhen data is moving, changing, and being usedânot just when it sits locked in storage.\nThe result: employees get accurate, real-time answers; executives know proprietary information never leaks; compliance teams have full, tamper-proof audit trails. Data becomes as actionable as the business requires, no longer as vulnerable as the technology allows.\nâ\nIndustry Validation: The Confidential Computing Revolution\nOPAQUE isn't alone in recognizing the critical need for confidential AI. Tech giants are building their entire AI infrastructure on similar principles. Apple's Private Cloud Compute uses confidential computing to process AI requests without exposing user dataâeven to Apple itself. Meta's Private Processing enables AI features while keeping personal data encrypted end-to-end. These industry leaders understand what's at stake: as AI becomes more powerful, the only sustainable path forward is one where data protection is built into the foundation, not bolted on as an afterthought.\nFor enterprises, this validation matters. When Apple stakes its reputation on confidential computing for consumer privacy, and Meta rebuilds its AI infrastructure around end-to-end encryption, it signals a fundamental shift in how the industry approaches AI security. The question isn't whether to adopt confidential computing for AIâit's how quickly you can implement it before falling behind.\nâ\nReal-World Impact: What Changes & Who Benefits?\nFor most companies, adopting AI used to mean choosing between speed and airtight security. Confidential RAG ends that tradeoff, and the real-world results speak for themselves.\nAcross industries, confidential RAG is transforming productivity and cost-efficiency by slashing response times, boosting output, and reducing operating costs as manual review and post-incident firefighting disappear.\nServiceNowâs experience\nbrings these gains into focus. Before confidential RAG, their sellers and teams waited days for answers as requests bounced from desk to desk, stuck behind approvals and compliance reviews.\nAfter deploying confidential RAG, ServiceNow delivered answers to sellers 99% faster, cutting response times from four days to eight seconds. Help desks reported a 41% increase in output, and some areas saw a 56% reduction in operating costs.Â\nAfter deploying confidential RAG, those same questions are answered almost instantly. Information flows quickly, but privacy and control never slip. IT spends less time managing leaks and more time delivering value, while auditors get a complete, tamper-proof record of every step.\nAccentureâs research leads to the same conclusion. Companies that close the encryption gap donât just avoid troubleâthey unlock new value.\nâ\nOne global bank reduced their AI compliance review cycle from 12 weeks to 2 days, accelerating time-to-value by 84%. A leading B2B SaaS platform serving Fortune 500 enterprises shortened their enterprise deal cycles by 47 days on averageâfrom 180 to 133 daysâby demonstrating verifiable data sovereignty controls that eliminated CISO objections.\nâ\n\"Our ability to prove that customer data never leaves their control, even when processed by our AI features, removed the biggest blocker in our enterprise sales process,\" their CRO reported. \"This translated directly to our bottom line: our net revenue retention jumped from 112% to 139% as existing customers finally felt confident enabling our AI-powered modules they'd been avoiding due to data concerns.\"\nâ\nThe result is clearer for the business, the auditors, and anyone asking, âCan we actually trust our AI with this?â\nWith Confidential RAG, the answer is finally yes.\nLooking Ahead: Beyond Confidential Rag to Confidential Agents\nConfidential RAG is the foundation, but itâs not the ceiling. As organizations get comfortable protecting sensitive data in the moment, the next wave is already forming: confidential agents.\nHere, AI doesnât just answer questions; it coordinates tasks, juggles approvals, and even makes decisions that once required layers of human checkpoints. Imagine a pipeline where AI agents not only retrieve information, but kick off complex sequencesâpulling from multiple systems, flagging issues, and asking for human sign-off only when absolutely needed.\nFinancial services companies are taking these steps, moving from classic data pipelines to fully automated, multi-agent environments. Sensitive data flows, but always through attested, governed checkpoints. Every move is logged, every policy enforced, every step ready for audit.\nBut for most enterprises, todayâs priority is clear. If the basics arenât in placeâif Confidential RAG isnât protecting your core data in real timeâyouâre not ready for whatâs coming next.\nAgentic workflows promise unmatched speed and business value. But they rely on trust built at the Confidential Rag level. Get that right, and youâre ready for the next leap. Ignore it, and tomorrowâs ambitions will hit the same wall that once blocked real-time AI in the first place.\nConfidential RAG isnât just a milestone. Itâs the springboard.\nâ\nThe Real Risk Is Waiting\nThe rush to put AI to work with sensitive data isnât slowing down. The rules have changedâprivacy isnât a bonus, itâs a baseline. Confidential RAG moves protection from the gate to the heart of every answer, making risky trade-offs a thing of the past.\nThe companies that win wonât be the fastest or the flashiest. Theyâll be the ones who treat trust as a non-negotiable, building on systems that keep their best data safe the moment AI touches it. Any delay is just leaving doors open.\nIf you havenât rethought your data pipeline yet, nowâs the time.Â\nReady to architect AI that's both powerful and trustworthy?

CrewAI is clocking 60 million+ agents a month for the worldâs biggest organizations, and usage isnât creeping upâitâs doubling, fast.\nAs an open-source agentic automation platform thatâs seen rapid enterprise uptake, CrewAI offers a front-row view into how modern agent infrastructure is scaling in real world production. While this isnât a deep-dive case study, their data and deployment patterns illustrate the industryâs direction: from isolated pilots to business-critical automation.\nThe Quantum Risk is Realâand Itâs Coming Fast\nBut as enterprises wire up these agents into production, the ground is shifting. Quantum computing advances from Google, Microsoft, and the open source ecosystem are eroding the security of yesterdayâs cryptography. Each leap forward makes it easier for attackers to break todayâs encryptionâleaving agent-driven workflows exposed to tomorrowâs threats.\nSo hereâs the critical strategic question: How do you keep scaling what works, without building your future on a cryptographic time bomb? Itâs not enough to keep growing agent stacks. Now is the time to connect agent infrastructure with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), while thereâs still time to get ahead of both attackers and auditors. Early movers will set the paceâand keep controlâwhen it matters most.\nScaling Agents for Impact: Lessons from CrewAIâs Production Deployments\nEvery technology leader faces the inflection point: early pilots are showing results, the board is asking for outcomes, and itâs time for the callââDo we have the foundation to scale this in production, for real?â For teams watching CrewAIâs deployments, the numbers answer for themselves.\nCrewAIâs journey isnât unique, but itâs unusually well-documented and at enterprise scale, making them a useful bellwether for agent adoption. We arenât talking about a handful of test cases or isolated sprints. This is millions of agents executing real work every month\n,\nwith measurable outcomes: efficiency gains that show up on actual bottom linesâ94% (and thatâs not an estimate).\nWhere does the 94% number come from?\nIt comes from a CrewAI case study shared by CEO Joe Mora during his â\nCrewAI Orchestrating Agent Workflows\nâ talk at the Confidential Computing Summit 2025. In that presentation, Mora described how a global beverage company used CrewAI agents to automate price operations, resulting in a 94% reduction in manual work.\nOPAQUE has highlighted CrewAI as an industry bellwetherânot because of sponsorships or partnershipsâbut because their scale, operational transparency, and independently validated results offer a concrete, verifiable example of what agentic infrastructure is delivering in the field, along with the hard realities of making it work at production scale.\nHow do early wins turn into everyday practice? It almost always starts the same way. The teams that get the best results begin with clear, measurable use casesâthink approvals, contracts, or back-office work. When the value shows up right away and everyone can see it, the focus quickly shifts from âdoes this help?â to âhow fast can we roll it out everywhere?â\nSimply adding more agents doesnât shift the game. Momentum builds when organizations replace scattered pilots with standardized, interoperable, and governable stacks. The winning move is picking tools that cooperate easily, bridge clouds and teams, and donât saddle you with a patchwork of one-off solutions.\nThe tactical edge comes from structure: rapid iteration is essential, but trust and transparency do just as much heavy lifting. The organizations that see lasting valueâmeasurable valueâanchor their efforts in open standards, routine verification, and governance built for real-world scale.\nStill, not every deployment makes the leap. According to recent Accenture data presented at the 2025 Confidential Computing Summit, only\n13% of enterprises\nsee value from their GenAI investments. The difference? Discipline and clarity. A strong foundation, not a runaway headcount, separates those who thrive from those who stall out.\nSo, if your teamâs at the âare we ready?â stage, the sharper question is: does your agent foundation support real, resilient scale?\nEngineering Forward: Preparing for the Quantum Threat\nThe quantum clock is ticking, whether organizations like it or not. Most agent infrastructure still relies on RSA and ECCâcryptographic standards that quantum computers will break. At our 2025 Summit, nobody argued that quantum acceleration was speculative: Googleâs Vilo chip just solved a âdecades-longâ problem in minutes. Meanwhile, PQC deployments arenât just theoryâChrome, Google Cloud, and core open source libraries like BoringSSL are putting PQC into production or advanced preview, while most enterprises are still catching up.\nAnd the squeeze is coming from more than just attackers. Regulatory frameworks, from the EU AI Act to updated rules in financial services, now require not just adoption of new cryptography, but proof that youâre movingâroadmaps, evidence, and standards that auditors can actually verify.\nLetâs put the old playbook side by side with where you need to be:\nFuture-Ready Agent Infrastructure: Strengthening Today's Operations Against Tomorrow's Threats\nRight now, Chrome, Google Cloud, and open source libraries like BoringSSL are shipping PQC by default, but most enterprises are still stuck in planning mode. Meanwhile, regulators (see: EU AI Act, new financial mandates) are already asking not just for technical upgrades, but for proof that youâre movingâand a live migration roadmap to show them.\nQuantum-resilient architecture isnât a future feature. Itâs the ground floor. If your stack isnât already agile, evidence-based, and built to swap out cryptography fast, youâre betting the house on borrowed time.\nDesigning a Future-Ready Agent Stack\nThe consensus from the Summit was clear: if you want agent infrastructure that actually holds up under pressure, your stack needs a few fundamentalsânothing flashy, just the basics done right.\nBehavioral attestation:\nEvery agent action should leave a clear, tamper-proof record. You want to know exactly what happened, when, and which agent was responsibleâno gaps or missing details.\nDynamic identity and code transparency:\nGive every agent a unique, verifiable identity, and tie every action to the actual code, input, and data used. If something goes sideways, you can pinpoint the cause without delay.\nCryptographic agility:\nMake updates possible without disruption. When itâs time to move to PQC or update, you should be able to do it with minimal hassle. No rebuilding systems. No downtime.\nComposability and open standards:\nBuild with modular parts that play well with tools from any vendor. Open APIs and standard interfaces make it easier to plug in new capabilities, track activity, and enforce policy across your stack.\nNo single vendor delivers all of this in one package. The practical move is to require open connections and real interoperabilityâespecially for attestation, verification, and policy enforcementâso your trust isnât bottlenecked by one provider or product.\nWhen these requirements are baked into daily operations, youâre not left waiting for an annual review or crossing your fingers that security measures will hold. You have visibility and proof every day.\nHow to Scale Securely and Future-Proof Trust\nReady to move from guidelines to action? These steps are how leading teams are putting quantum-ready agent security into practiceânot just on paper, but in live deployments.\nImplement cryptographic abstraction in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)\nDonât tie your stack to one cryptographic primitive. Build abstraction layers into your pipelines so you can swap algorithms (including PQC) as standards shift. This makes migration a configuration update, not a rebuild.\nInventory dependencies and bottlenecks\nList every open-source and commercial dependency in your stack and map their readiness for PQC and attestation. Identify what can be upgraded easily and flag areas that might slow or block your migration timeline.\nEstablish Verifiable Trust Before Execution\nSet up pre-execution attestation for agents, LLMs, and AI workflows. Require verification before anything moves toward deploymentâfrom code to policies to the workflows themselves. This pre-verification creates your first line of defense.\nMaintain Trust During Execution\nKeep verification active throughout every workflow. Once pre-verified components are running, enforce continuous policy checks to ensure only attested code and workflows remain in production. This dual approachâverify first, monitor alwaysâcreates a complete trust chain.\nRequire proof from every vendor\nWhen evaluating solutions or choosing vendors, make PQC readiness and attestation capability non-negotiable. Insist on cryptographically verifiable, tamper-proof audit logs as evidenceânot just promisesâduring technical due diligence.\nCross-train teams for agility\nAI, security, infrastructure, and risk functions need shared context. Provide ongoing education so every team understands PQC timelines, agent trust models, and migration stepsânot just in theory, but as practical know-how.\nThe organizations that follow these steps arenât just âpreparingâ for quantumâtheyâre building agentic infrastructure that stands up to new risks and scrutiny, now and next quarter.\nQuick Self-Assessment: Where Do You Stand?\nAfter youâve acted, itâs time to look at whatâs real. Donât rely on wishful thinkingâget specific and take inventory:\nAre your agent deployments covered by clear governance, and do they work across clouds and business unitsâor is oversight still patchwork?\nHow much of your stack can you verify, right now, if asked? Can you prove code paths and actions?\nDo you have an inventory and migration plan for all cryptographic components, or only loose plans and vendor promises?\nIs your architecture vendor-neutral and standards-based, or will you be left waiting on others to update?\nAre your teams comfortable discussing and executing PQC migration, attestation, and incident responseâor are there expertise gaps?\nIf there are weak spots or unknowns in your answers, you know where to focus next. Momentum comes from closing those gaps and being able to show whatâs done, not just whatâs intended.\nReady to see how your agent stack and quantum strategy hold up?

From parsing massive PDFs to synthesizing insights across disparate data sources, the potential for AI to drive productivity is immense. But thereâs a problemâone that every knowledge worker and innovation lead knows all too well.\nThe AI Roadblock: Security Concerns Around Sensitive Data\nYouâve been there. You bring a high-impact use case to your security team:\nâI want to use an LLM to analyze this 87-page internal report.â\nOr: âCan I combine data from multiple secure sources to generate insights for this research initiative?â\nToo often, the answer is âNo.â\nSecurity teams, rightfully cautious, are asking important questions:\nWill the LLM train on our data?\nCould the information be leaked?\nWhat guarantees do we have about how the model will behave?\nThese unknowns are enough to freeze progressâand kill promising AI projects before they begin.\nEnter Opaque: Confidential AI for the Enterprise\nAt Opaque, weâre solving this exact problem. Our confidential AI platform enables enterprises to leverage the power of AIâ\nwithout compromising on data privacy, governance, or compliance\n.\nHereâs how it works:\nEncrypted Data Sources\n: When a data source is connected, it remains encrypted end-to-end. The data owner retains full control of the encryption keysâensuring that no one else, not even the platform, can access raw data.\nAttested Models & Agents\n: All models and agents are registered, verified, and run in a secure environment built on trusted hardware. This ensures they only operate within clearly defined parameters.\nVerifiable Audit Logs\n: Every interaction is logged, backed by a hardware root of trust, and made tamper-proof. This allows third-party verification and satisfies even the most stringent compliance requirements.\nFrom Months to Minutes: Unlocking AI Use Cases Safely\nInstead of waiting months for a green lightâor worse, sticking to manual processesâteams can now get to production fast. Security and compliance teams get full visibility and control. Business teams get the tools they need to move forward.\nAt Opaque, weâre making it possible to bring AI into the enterpriseâ\nsecurely, confidently, and with the urgency todayâs business demands\n.\nRelated Content\nShowing\n28\nGuardRail OSS, open source project, provides guardrails for responsible AI development\nThis is some text inside of a div block.\nGENERAL\nRead More\nNo items found.\nHave a question about OPAQUEâs Confidential Computing Platform or want to see a live demo?\nReach out here\nCOMPANY\nHome\nAbout\nResources\nCareers\nContact\nSOLUTIONS\nInsurance\nFinance\nHigh-Tech\nContact\n[email protected]\nLinkedIn\nX (Formerly Twitter)\nÂ© 2024 OPAQUE Systems, Inc.

The emergence of Confidential Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a transformative solution, enabling organizations to harness AI while upholding the highest standards of data privacy and regulatory compliance.\nWhether your audit processes are built around workersâ compensation, general liability, or healthcare claims, Confidential RAG gives teams a way to streamline reporting, uncover risks faster, and improve decision-making without compromising on security.\nSee It in Action: AI-Powered Audit Automation Demo\nWeâve put together a short demonstration that brings this use case to life.\nWatch\nhow a secure, chat-based AI interface can generate periodic and employer-specific audit reports from encrypted dataâwith verifiable security guarantees.\nIn this demo, youâll see:\nSecure connection and formatting of raw audit data\nDynamic generation of audit reports (PDF and Excel)\nEmployer-level insights on demand\nEnd-to-end data protection with verifiable audit logs\nâ\nhttps://youtu.be/_IoO7buREAU\nâ\nFrom Experiments to Enterprise-Ready AI\nAIâs potential in insurance is well recognizedâbut most organizations remain stuck in experimentation. What moves the needle is bridging consumer-like AI experiences with enterprise-grade protections. Confidential RAG does just that. It enables you to query, format, and generate insights from sensitive audit dataâwithout ever exposing that data to unauthorized parties or platforms.\nWhether youâre dealing with policy-level compliance reports, claims audit records, or internal performance metrics, Confidential RAG offers a way to leverage that data securely within AI systems. And unlike traditional RAG methods, this approach wraps every query in end-to-end encryption, backed by cryptographic proofs that your data wasnât leaked or tampered with.\nKey Use Cases Across the Audit Spectrum\nAuditors, analysts, and compliance teams can benefit from Confidential RAG in numerous ways:\nDynamic Report Generation\n: Create automated audit reports filtered by time period or specific clients, and export them in PDF or Excelâdirectly from a secure AI chat interface.\nEntity-Specific Analysis\n: Query AI with natural language to retrieve audit findings for a single employer or policyholder, all while ensuring the underlying data remains confidential.\nWorkflow Compatibility\n: Seamlessly integrate into existing audit workflowsâwhether your data resides in Excel files, live databases, or proprietary formats. With notebook-style and no-code interfaces, the system fits into both technical and non-technical environments.\nDesigned for Security & Speed\nOPAQUEâs confidential AI infrastructure is built for highly regulated environments like insurance. Every interaction with audit data is encrypted, and your organization maintains full control over encryption keys.\nVerifiable Audit Logs\nEach interaction creates a traceable, exportable log that proves compliance to internal and external stakeholders.\nRapid Time-to-Value\nDeployments can go live with minimal lift from your internal teams, thanks to a simplified, phased rollout approach.\nThe Future of Auditing Is Confidentialâand AI-Powered\nWith Confidential RAG, the insurance industry can finally realize the promise of AIâwithout compromising trust or compliance. Itâs no longer about choosing between innovation and regulation. Itâs about using the right tools to confidently do both.\nReady to deploy confidential agents with your sensitive data while maintaining compliance and audit trails?\nð\nDiscover why leading organizations choose\nConfidential Agents for RAG\n.
