A few quick clarifying items so we can source the right candidates:\n\n- Could you share the full job description and (if possible) Alex's profile as a benchmark?\n- Is the role remote, hybrid, or region-specific (timezone/location preferences)?\n- Any visa/relocation constraints or required employment type (contract vs. W2/direct hire)?\n- Please confirm the interview process and target decision timeline.\n\nIf that works, we’ll begin outreach as soon as we have the JD. Our plan is to present an initial shortlist of 3 qualified candidates within 5 business days. Are you available for a 30-minute call to align on requirements and the interview loop?
